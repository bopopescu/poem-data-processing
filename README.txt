Data is not included in this repository - for poems.csv run the scraper in poemfiles and download the glove word vectors from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ and place them in the glove directory. Additionally, the poem sentence generator itself can be found and trained in the repository https://github.com/timbmg/Sentence-VAE.
