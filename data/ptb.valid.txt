while heaven looks from its towers ! 
how say you ? let us , o my dove , 
as earth lies bare to heaven above ! 
how is it under our control 
to love or not to love ? 
i would that you were all to me , 
you that are just so much , no more . 
nor yours nor mine , nor slave nor free ! 
where does the fault lie ? what the core 
o ' the wound , since wound must be ? 
see with your eyes , and set my heart 
beating by yours , and drink my fill 
at your soul 's springs , -your part my part 
in life , for good and ill . 
no . i yearn upward , touch you close , 
then stand away . i kiss your cheek , 
catch your soul 's warmth , -i pluck the rose 
and love it more than tongue can speak- 
then the good minute goes . 
already how am i so far 
out of that minute ? must i go 
still like the thistle-ball , no bar , 
onward , whenever light winds blow , 
fixed by no friendly star ? 
just when i seemed about to learn ! 
where is the thread now ? off again ! 
the old trick ! only i discern- 
infinite passion , and the pain 
of finite hearts that yearn . 
one named peter , one named paul . 
fly away , peter ! fly away , paul ! 
come back , peter ! come back , paul ! 
some girls on the other side of this planet 
will never know the loveliness 
they will spend their days on their backs 
for a parade of men who could be their uncles 
through the stale tea air and auto-rickshaw 
for one hour in a room 
with a twelve-year-old . one hour - one hour - 
one hour . and if she cries afterward , 
her older sister will cover it up . will rim 
until it looks like two silk moths 
have stopped to rest on her exquisite face . 
they 've perched for hours 
on that window-ledge , scarcely 
moving . beak to beak , 
almost imperceptibly- 
it 's an event when they tuck 
turning because they must 
have turned-somehow , they 've 
taken on the grave , 
small-eyed aspect of monks 
so intimate nothing need 
their bread , these are content 
it 's all the human 
imagination can fathom , 
how single-mindedly 
mindless two silhouettes 
stand in a window thick 
as milk glass . they appear 
never to have fed on 
anything else when they stir 
all of a sudden to peck 
feathers of the other ; 
but when they resume 
their places , the shift 
is one only a painter 
back into position ) 
would be likely to notice . 
evening the priest 
let three rivers flow 
and a woman sing to her child 
i am afraid a woman 
will burn my hair 
i went into one room and then i went into another . 
i was in a room inside a room . 
there i felt safe . 
behold the rocky wall 
that down its sloping sides 
in rushing river-tides ! 
turned by a pebble 's edge , 
through the cleft mountain-ledge . 
to evening 's ocean , with the tangled braid 
so from the heights of will 
life 's parting stream descends , 
each widening torrent bends , - 
from the same cradle 's side , 
from the same mother 's knee , - 
one to long darkness and the frozen tide , 
one to the peaceful sea ! 
it was your idea 
to park and watch the elephants 
swaying among the trees 
i did n't know anything that big 
could be so quiet . 
and once , you stopped 
on a dark desert road 
to show me the stars 
climbing over each other 
like insects 
thrashing its way 
through time itself 
i never saw light that way 
again . 
when he took his friends into the countryside 
to look at blossoms , they all saw chinese blossoms . 
had sunk two feet . the following year was better . 
he saw bubbles of crab-froth among the river reeds . 
one was fire red , 
hand carved and new- 
the local maker pried the wood 
the devil 's instrument 
wrenched from the house of god . 
bright and sharp as a young wine , 
they said , but it would mellow , 
and that i would grow into it . 
the other one was yellow 
a one-piece back of tiger maple 
a century old , they said , 
its sound will never change . 
thin on the upper range , 
and how it came from the old world 
was anybody 's guess- 
light as an exile 's suitcase , 
a belly of emptiness : 
that was the one i chose 
( not the one of flame ) 
and teachers would turn in their practiced hands 
to see whence the sad notes came . 
two went to pray ? o rather say 
one stands up close and treads on high , 
one nearer to god 's altar trod , 
the other to the altar 's god . 
in the forests of the night ; 
what immortal hand or eye , 
could frame thy fearful symmetry ? 
burnt the fire of thine eyes ? 
on what wings dare he aspire ? 
what the hand , dare seize the fire ? 
and what shoulder , & amp ; what art , 
and when thy heart began to beat , 
what dread hand ? & amp ; what dread feet ? 
what the hammer ? what the chain , 
in what furnace was thy brain ? 
what the anvil ? what dread grasp , 
when the stars threw down their spears 
and water 'd heaven with their tears : 
did he smile his work to see ? 
did he who made the lamb make thee ? 
in the forests of the night : 
what immortal hand or eye , 
dare frame thy fearful symmetry ? 
when i wake , this is what i tell myself : 
i belong to this , to all the ghosts present 
of my body . it seems the proper gift 
from my father , memory locked down in the cells 
is my father 's complaint . he rings at two 
in the morning . a piss in the pot , a shot 
in the dark . he 's never too far away . 
this is the deepest part of the world . 
bird do n't fly here , 
but there is the sound of wings . 
the smell , just a struggle in the earth 
monsters hatch fully-grown from their eggs . 
to her feet pointed backwards . 
i roll off the back of a skull strapped on top 
caught at the entrance of a ditch 
feathery moths 
flutter on the screen 
sounds of summer 
oblivious tonight 
that my reading light 
is not my day 
stout bodies 
near a crack 
in the screen 
and beat inside 
a paper shade 
natural presence 
we are drawn 
by the moths 
to other lights 
down the road 
the land where golden apples grow ; 
but that , ah ! that was long ago . 
how far , since then , the ocean streams 
have swept us from that land of dreams , 
that land of fiction and of truth , 
whither , ah , whither ? are not these 
where sea-gulls scream , and breakers roar , 
and wreck and sea-weed line the shore ? 
we lower our sails ; a while we rest 
from the unending , endless quest . 
when i push your button 
you fly off the handle , 
old skin and bones , 
black bat wing . 
we 're alike , you and i . 
both of us 
resemble my mother , 
the most vulnerable child 
who 'll catch his death 
in this tempest . 
sometimes it requires 
all my strength 
just to end a line . 
but when the wind is at 
my back , we 're likely 
to get carried away , and say 
down , an old stony 
word like ruin . you 're what roof 
i have , frail thing , 
you 're my argument 
against the whole sky . 
between wet and dry . 
the street i walk along i often see 
as if i 'd long since left the moving surface 
us all some day without return but free 
a feeling of absolute happiness has to make 
itself felt , as if from outside me , so much 
that it , the entire city , and its uncertain space 
have become one with the mobile but faithful pattern 
of phrases written by our steps when we move about . 
i no longer know who 's walking and marking out 
the ground , bit by bit , to the corner . my gaze then patterns 
itself on tomorrow 's unknown eyes , which will shine 
and my invisible trace on the asphalt below 
will they know what i sometimes suspect : what appears 
to be the distracted gaze with which we see 
the world is the world itself ? -it sees and hears 
i was looking for your hair , 
black as old lava on an island 
of white coral . i dreamed it 
deserted you and came for me , 
wrapped me in its funeral ribbons 
and tied me a bow of salt . 
to the sweet desert of your slate . 
of my species , twin sun to a world 
to the syrup of the moon , you boil 
my bones in the absence of hands . 
where is your skin , parting me ? 
teasing into purple valleys ? where 
are your wings , the imaginary tail 
and its exercise ? where would i breed 
you ? in the neck of my secret heart 
where you 'll go to the warmth of me 
biting into that bread where crumbs crack 
and scatter and feed us our souls ; 
if only you were a stone i could 
throw , if only i could have you . 
a man 's poem of course-the electric ah ! 
drunk on rapture-drink my brother he calls to me , 
stream that floats a river past your house and drop 
along the shore to shelter your children . 
what release ! 
and of a sudden-it just happens-you let go 
and he 's off on his own , free for that first time- 
the stones resting in the driveway , the cat curled asleep 
on the front porch , the smear of blood 
the morning paper and its stories shouting 
and perhaps 
somewhere a friend is dreaming of me , or someone 
true or not . it is no matter . 
under the edge of february 
in hawk of a throat 
in its solitude of bruises 
its beautiful mask of fish net 
changing into a mask of rubber bands 
who will enter this beautiful beautiful mask of 
compound of hearts compound of hearts 
where is the lucky number for this shy love 
this top-heavy beauty bathed with charcoal water 
self-conscious against a mosaic of broken bottles 
broken locks broken pipes broken 
broken promises 
every thought 
every performance 
how many stolen feet 
stolen fingers 
in you how many times 
in your solitude of bruises 
under the evening moon 
the snail 
is stripped to the waist . 
not rain , but fine mist 
falls from my lemon tree , 
six years now my mother gone to earth . 
this dew , light as footsteps of the dead . 
but her plans did n't work out . 
the tree goes on unceasingly-lemons fall 
and fold into earth and begin again- 
come to languish , to let the soft bursts- 
drift into my face and settle . water and gold 
of the season . leaves swallow the body 
my hands cup each other the way hers did . 
the poplars of blood have fallen asleep . 
the ancient shepherd , who shivers 
in his easter eyes has caught 
with rumors of burial to the praying field , 
it survives , the blue warped 
in iron , and on it , pupils shrouded , 
we have all seen them circling pastures , 
have looked up from the mouth of a barn , a pine clearing , 
but i had never seen so many so close , hundreds , 
every limb of the dead oak feathered black , 
and pull it toward the tree . 
red , ugly as a human heart . 
then , as i passed under their dream , i saw for the first time 
wrinkled and generous , like the faces of the very old 
and i drifted away from them , slow , on the pull of the river , 
calling them what i 'd never called them , what they are , 
who flock to the side of the poisoned fox , the mud turtle 
crushed on the shoulder of the road , 
who pray over the leaf-graves of the anonymous lost , 
with mercy enough to consume us all and give us wings . 
the dawn is here-and the long night through i have never seen thy face , 
though my feet have worn the patient grass at the gate of thy dwelling-place . 
while the white moon sailed till , red in the west , it found the far world edge , 
and the curtain shook with its gentle breath , white as young lilies are ; 
but there came no hand all the slow night through to draw the folds aside , 
three times in a low-hung nest there dreamed his five sweet notes a bird , 
shall i watch from afar and silently , as under the moon , for thy sake ? 
nay-bold in the sun i speak thy name , i too , and i wait no more 
and there 's room for much in a summer night , but no room for delay . 
from every hollow in the green hills that holds a pool in its cup . 
the young trees yearn on the breast of the wind that sighs of love as it goes . 
mist-white , moth-like , a spirit awake in the dark of forest dreams . 
shall the blossom wake , the star look down , all night and have naught to see ? 
shall the reeds that sing by the wind-brushed pool say nothing of thee and me ? 
-my darling comes ! my arms are content , my feet are guiding her way ; 
there is room for much in a summer night , but no room for delay ! 
the place we lived was only an idea , 
nothing to do with the failed cotton mill town 
were all we ever cared to call our own . 
from nightmares of a happy life with kids 
we met each other in the common room 
and found somehow without the help of light 
our way across the river by the time 
we 'd come to , single , sobered-up again , 
to see the morning glories give their thanks 
for things we had , and hardly noticed , then . 
i did n't get much sleep last night 
thinking about underwear 
have you ever stopped to consider 
underwear in the abstract 
when you really dig into it 
underwear is something 
we all have to deal with 
everyone wears 
some kind of underwear 
wears underwear 
i saw him on tv 
he must have had tight underwear 
underwear can really get you in a bind 
for men and women 
so alike but so different 
women 's underwear holds things up 
men 's underwear holds things down 
underwear is one thing 
men and women have in common 
underwear is all we have between us 
you have seen the three-color pictures 
and three-way stretch 
promising full freedom of action 
do n't be deceived 
it 's all based on the two-party system 
which does n't allow much freedom of choice 
the way things are set up 
america in its underwear 
struggles thru the night 
take foundation garments for instance 
of underground government 
making people believe 
something but the truth 
telling you what you can or ca n't do 
did you ever try to get around a girdle 
perhaps non-violent action 
is the only answer 
and that spot she was always rubbing- 
was it really in her underwear ? 
always washing and washing and washing 
out damned spot 
underwear with spots very suspicious 
underwear on clothesline a great flag of freedom 
someone has escaped his underwear 
may be naked somewhere 
help ! 
but do n't worry 
everybody 's still hung up in it 
there wo n't be no real revolution 
and poetry still the underwear of the soul 
and underwear still covering 
a multitude of faults 
if i were you i 'd keep aside 
do not go naked into that good night 
and in the meantime 
keep calm and warm and dry 
'over nothing ' 
move forward with dignity 
hand in vest 
and death shall have no dominion 
there 's plenty of time my darling 
are we not still young and easy 
do n't shout 
web . 
and then , 
down the shaft , 
as greater under-primary 
and down-plumped , 
a pattern 
just over the down 
the lesser pigeons , 
always first 
to find 
sport black 
spiral , a paper 
of words 
and keys 
that shift with 
is crossed with 
rage . but 
word-burdened , instinct- 
tossed , searching for the perch within 
a blasted atmosphere . find forms , the message says , and 
everything will fall in line . 
the bird is in the 
is like saying 
you can fall in love with 
which , 
of course , 
is one of the things that turns on 
my tuned-up engine 
when i think of your ankles ) 
and i find myself 
a sad poet , 
wanting to touch your arms and feel the muscles 
that make a man 's body have so much substance , 
that makes a woman 
lean and yearn in that direction 
that makes her melt/ she is a rainy day 
in your presence 
the pool of wax under a burning candle 
the foam from a waterfall 
you are more beautiful than any harley-davidson 
she is the rain , 
waits in it for you , 
from the long ride . 
i had a calling . 
i took the call . 
it was all i could do to follow the voice streaming into me 
down to gather . 
into the jet 's jets . 
i could have fallen too 
freeze-out lake . 
for it is fine to lie within one 's borrowed blankets 
looking up at the 
dropped ceiling coming down . 
i feel at one with extinction 
by my own hand 
( inner hand ) 
though once there were many of my kind 
it felt that way . 
out of cash , out of well-fitting trousers , 
out of soap and apples , 
out of pencils , out of my keeper 's 
reach . 
but may not . this morning 
( last night ) in the common room 
of oxygen to one who had none 
and i would not sit down , demanding 
to do so . 
later i happened on a man 
at the piano , and though i have happened five or six times 
on men at the piano , 
none moved his hand like this 
within the keys . 
i sat beside him , looking for a sound 
a chest sound . not listening ; i do n't listen 
anymore . i make music 
but i do n't listen . 
as the father turns away from the thought 
of his failure , the hands remove 
his glasses and rub his eyes over 
unknown to the one who is troubled 
about losing his hair , his fingers stroke 
our constant companion , understands 
driveway , embracing herself after the guests 
who promised more and soon have gone , 
who reads the same happy ending to each 
new class , working her toes in her shoes . 
how could the people of the kingdom 
not have known the curse of sorrow 
was nothing more than a long sleep 
they had only to wake from ? in dreams 
too , suddenly lifts us above the dark 
roofs of our houses , and far above 
the streets of the town , until they seem 
like any other small things fastened to earth . 
as of next month , 
i 'm leaving much unfinished work , 
i was supposed to tell someone something , 
but i no longer know what and to whom : i 've forgotten . 
a wise word , a gift , a kiss ; 
i put it off from one day to the next . i 'm sorry . 
i 'll do it in the short time that remains . 
i was meant to visit 
distant cities , islands , desert lands ; 
you 'll have to cut them from the program 
i was supposed to plant trees and i did n't ; 
to build myself a house , 
maybe not beautiful , but based on plans . 
mainly , i had in mind 
a marvelous book , kind sir , 
which would have revealed many secrets , 
eased doubts , given many 
the gift of tears and laughter . 
you 'll find its outline in my drawer , 
down below , with the unfinished business ; 
i did n't have the time to write it out , which is a shame , 
translated from the italian 
a star screen shimmers under the moon over the urban center flashing on it red 
and green 
kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty 
belonging to a song bird , species unknown , which had sung 
so like a man goes into a shop and there 's like this other man in there whom he 
the child never gives up her secret , which-do n't tell-is that she has a secret , 
and her secret has a penis 
through them 
door swings shut 
i will proceed with good will-the best of wills-anxiously 
down a ham 
the boughs groan with fruit , an apple falls-false alarm 
it 's a non-sequitur-that 
uncle ) of theft 
none willing to give way to the others , shot of placid camels kneeling near 
but when he got to the threshold of his house his house said , go away , i am not at home . 
not at home ? a house is always at home ; where else can it be ? said the man . 
i am not at home to you , said his house . 
to blossom all the spring , 
in april , may , or else in june , 
when the small birds do sing : 
a gardener standing by , 
i desired him to choose for me ; 
he picked out the lily , the violet , and pink , 
but i refused all three . 
the lily i refused , 
because it faded so soon ; 
in june the red roses bud , 
oh , that is a lover for me ; 
but i have often aimed at the red rose-bud , 
and i have gained the willow tree . 
the gardener standing by , 
he prayed me to have a care , 
for the thorn that grew on the red rose-bush , 
for still i feel the smart ; 
and every time i did it touch , 
away you fading flowers , 
no more i will you touch , 
that all the world may plainly see 
i loved one flower too much . 
dear god , our heavenly father , gracious lord , 
mother love and maker , light divine , 
first letter of the alphabet , last word , 
i can say almost anything about you , 
create new reasons to believe or doubt you , 
but what 's the anything i must leave out ? you 
solve nothing but the problems that i set . 
half asleep in prayer i said the right thing 
and felt a sudden pleasure come into 
the room or my own body . in the dark , 
charged with a change of atmosphere , at first 
i could n't tell my body from the room . 
and i was wide awake , full of this feeling , 
a drawer pulled , and instead of terror knew 
i had said thanks and this was the response . 
but how i said it or what i said it for 
i still can not recall and i have tried 
all sorts of ways all hours of the night . 
on one pink cloud that stood beside the moon , 
drunk on the moon , a marble smile , and drunk , 
two young americans , on one another , 
far from home and wanting this forever- 
who needed god ? we had our bodies , bread , 
and glasses of a raw , green , local wine , 
enormous softly burning ancient stars . 
who needed god ? and why do i ask now ? 
because i 'm older and i think god stirs 
in details that keep bringing back that time , 
details that are just as vivid now- 
of the sleeves , i remember their weight , like wet wool , 
on my arms , and the empty ends which hung past my hands . 
of the body of the shirt , i remember the large buttons 
for a leg , a crowded feeling , a molasses to walk in . 
of my boots , i remember the brittle soles , of a material 
that had not been made love to by any natural substance , 
of the mortar , i remember the mortar plate , 
heavy enough to kill by weight , which i carried by rope . 
of the machine gun , i remember the way it fit 
behind my head and across my shoulder blades 
as i carried it , or , to be precise , as it rode me . 
the wrong man , the weight of the rifle bolt , the difficulty 
i do n't hear well now , for a man of my age , 
and the doctor says my ears were damaged and asks 
if i was in the army , and of course i was but then 
she notes in the poem she 's reading where the disembodied 
so that she 's quickly lost to view . that 's me , she thinks , 
i 'm an ugly old woman , i who sit here reading this poem 
and its ugly old woman phrase and the poet , when he stumbled 
her inheritance , her baggage of limitations-ugly , old , 
woman-but never knew , could n't , because who could 
know , who can stop and know her ... and this reader keeps 
thinking , loving , understanding , trapped in her eye 
following the voice on and on while somewhere back in the poem 
in a blank passage an ugly old woman sits against a wall . 
with the man i love who loves me not , 
i walked in the street-lamps ' flare ; 
we watched the world go home that night 
in a flood through union square . 
i leaned to catch the words he said 
ah well that he never leaned to hear 
the words my heart was calling . 
and on we walked and on we walked 
past the fiery lights of the picture shows - 
where the girls with thirsty eyes go by 
and on we walked and on we walked , 
at the door at last we said good-bye ; 
i knew by his smile he had not heard 
with the man i love who loves me not 
i walked in the street-lamps ' flare - 
but oh , the girls who ask for love 
in the lights of union square . 
as his 
why and by whose power were you sent ? 
what do you see that you may wish to steal ? 
why this dancing ? why do your dark bodies 
drink up all the light ? what are you demanding 
that we feel ? have you stolen something ? then 
what is that leaping in your chest ? what is 
the nature of your mission ? do you seek 
with others brought by us to harm ? then 
our night , hands raised , eyes wide , mute 
as ghosts ? is there something you wish to confess ? 
fail ? how and to whom do we address our appeal ? 
he looks with eyes of spy planes ; 
the residue from finite states of play . 
learns it 's more than structure symbols want . 
struggling to imagine the scent of mint , 
what did there recognize in cloud faces 
father of all ! in every age , 
by saint , by savage , and by sage , 
thou great first cause , least understood : 
to know but this-that thou art good , 
and that myself am blind : 
yet gave me , in this dark estate , 
to see the good from ill ; 
and binding nature fast in fate , 
left free the human will . 
this , teach me more than hell to shun , 
that , more than heaven pursue . 
what blessings thy free bounty gives , 
let me not cast away ; 
for god is paid when man receives , 
to enjoy is to obey . 
yet not to earth 's contracted span , 
thy goodness let me bound , 
or think thee lord alone of man , 
when thousand worlds are round : 
on each i judge thy foe . 
if i am right , thy grace impart , 
still in the right to stay ; 
if i am wrong , oh teach my heart 
to find a better way . 
save me alike from foolish pride , 
at aught thy wisdom has denied , 
or aught thy goodness lent . 
teach me to feel another 's woe , 
to hide the fault i see ; 
that mercy i to others show , 
that mercy show to me . 
mean though i am , not wholly so 
oh lead me wheresoe'er i go , 
through this day 's life or death . 
this day , be bread and peace my lot : 
all else beneath the sun , 
and let thy will be done . 
to thee , whose temple is all space , 
whose altar , earth , sea , skies ! 
one chorus let all being raise ! 
all nature 's incense rise ! 
and it rolls out : high , shrill and metallic . 
first the boy , then his sister . occasionally , 
they both let loose at once , and i think 
of putting on my shoes to go up and see 
upon the good crystal , which must surely 
lie shattered to dust on the floor . 
maybe the mother is still proud 
of the four pink lungs she nursed 
to such might . perhaps , if they hit 
will lift-off , and we 'll ride to glory 
their cries are cocked toward-let the sky 
pass from blue , to red , to molten gold , 
to black . let the heaven we inherit approach . 
whether it will bend down to greet us like a father , 
or swallow us like a furnace . i 'm ready 
to meet what refuses to let us keep anything 
wind rushing to knock our mirrors to the floor , 
to sweep our short lives clean . how mean 
come for us . and the kids upstairs still at it , 
screaming like the dawn of man , as if something 
they have no name for has begun to insist 
upon being born . 
the first track still almost swings . high hat and snare , even 
in molasses . so much for us . so much for the flags we bored 
into planets dry as chalk , for the tin cans we filled with fire 
disappears as if returning somewhere . 
who lies here with no stone to mark the place . 
as a boy reckless and wanton , 
wandering with gun in hand through the forest 
i shot a hawk perched on the top 
of a dead tree . 
at my feet , his wing broken . 
then i put him in a cage 
when i offered him food . 
for the soul of the hawk , 
that i may offer him the friendship 
of one whom life wounded and caged . 
out along the last curve in the brick walk 
the grass has begun to green , 
with the freezing cold and coming snow 
its certain fate . 
the cranes make the same mistake , 
just before the worst blizzard of winter 
makes it impossible to tell the field from the river . 
arriving too early , staying on too late , 
the cranes , the grass , they tell us : 
this can go on for millions of years . 
but it is not always quiet here . 
things go on while we sleep the sleep of soldiers . 
ancient branches crack and splinter into dust . 
large wings snap open in spring 
granite splits apart at the seams 
daily , in the density , there is life 
on the edge of the knife that cuts the world 
to turn yourself loose , like new leaves , 
like big lakes on which swim enormous birds 
their shadows pull you to the shore . 
their size fills your lungs with sky . it is time 
to come back out like a bear after the thaw , to be 
and waning moons . you will get soaked in wet grass , 
feel the insects pierce your skin . you will learn 
to balance between gravity and light . there will be 
hot and sticky nights , sharp songs at dawn , 
this is your chance to crash your way 
she does this thing . our seventeen- 
year-old dog . our mostly deaf dog . 
speaking . when i crouch . 
when i put my mouth to her ear 
and shout her name . she walks away . 
walks toward the nothing of speech . 
she even trots down the drive , ears up , 
as if my voice is coming home . 
it 's like watching a child 
believe in christmas , right 
before you burn the tree down . 
every time i do it , i think , this time 
she 'll turn to me . this time 
she 'll put voice to face . this time , 
which is like being a child 
who believes in christmas 
as santa lights a smoke 
we say lightning has no wings 
when it slides down our houses 
we say loss is just a condition 
we say the bleeding hands 
on the table filled with red wine 
who we have become 
no groves or shakespeare 
to return to 
we apologize for the fear 
growing out of our ribs 
apologize for the numbers 
still etched on our tongues 
ca n't hear things well if they are things whispering . nothing gentle to 
a heart is a physical object singing in the chest . chamber doors 
when one writes of light as a painted smile across face . you call 
words . 
flush . yes , if you see a nature painting you ponder a spot to express self . 
think of hole digging and burial afterward . a courtesy thing . some mass 
constant flush ? 
you mean , if you were to see this world through black-light vision , 
knowing everything covered in 
, this planet would be a beautiful glow . 
there are some things we just do n't talk about- 
not even in the morning , when we 're waking , 
the slope of my waist : 
how love 's a rust-worn boat , 
abandoned at the dock-and who could doubt 
our wreckage as a promise , so we do n't talk . 
we wet the tired oars , tide drawing us out . 
we understand there 's nothing to be said . 
warned by the tide-worn driftwood of our pasts- . 
a slow wake though the water-then silently , 
we start to row , and will for as long as this lasts . 
in the end no surprise of reports of you dying younger than your gods 
it 's a human thing , pants at your ankles , leaving unclean 
because life 's road is only one night in a bad motel 
harry , you could play basketball in your bare feet , and win 
for the names of those sad and silly girls you wanted to get right 
night after night , alone in l.a . 
in one more borrowed car with one more borrowed fiction 
oh yes , you must have been laughing 
cruising the left coast on sheer gall 
but mostly , at 3 
a.m . 
, in the local playground , harry 
you played solitary ball 
and dreamed of final seconds in a distant game 
you drove to the sacred bucket with a fury 
no harm , no foul , nothing but net . 
but all alone , in the heart of west hollywood , harry , 
my garden is the wild 
sea of the grass . her garden 
the tide could break in ; 
i should be sorry for this . 
there is peace there of a kind , 
though not the deep peace 
of wild places . her care 
the weak things to grow . 
despite my first love , 
i take sometimes her hand , 
following straight paths 
the old softness of lawns 
the wild hawk of the mind . 
but not for long , windows , 
opening in the trees 
call the mind back 
here only in play . 
a huge purple door washed up in the bay overnight , 
over the cliff , except for the girl , who lived now 
by the light and heat of a driftwood fire on a beach . 
or landing-stage , but it was all bullshit , the usual idle talk . 
that 's when he left and never returned . him i wo n't name - 
a famous non-swimmer , but last seen sailing out , 
with tell-tale flashes of almost certainly purple paint . 
lord , 
when you send the rain 
think about it , please , 
a little ? 
not get carried away 
by the sound of falling water , 
the marvelous light 
on the falling water . 
am beneath that water . 
it falls with great force 
and the light 
me to the light . 
i do n't own an exquisite way to move around in the night 
it occurs to me that , 
when i die , 
they might find the necklace 
i dropped behind the bed 
and wonder 
how long it was there , 
and whether i 'd missed it . 
but will they care 
about my favorite color , 
my long-range plans , 
or my habit of searching myself 
for signs of rust ? 
and her life folds over . against the cold , the waiting 
for the what will happen . the next . wonderful 
awful . the blonde in a chemical bath . 
the story keeps on being written 
as a woman who waits for never to happen 
as an empty wall waits for light to form a bridge 
and under it , a mass of open eyes , 
and yes is what is said . then here it is , the box 
we live in where the crazy face of the day looks back 
at the closed eye of the night looking in . 
a boy of four comes in as an example 
of where the door of life is left open for a moment . 
some glass is for looking through , some is for seeing back . 
every outline is a cage one way or another . 
honored when 
the butterfly lights 
on my shoulder . 
next stop : 
a rotting log . 
children grown- 
on half the kitchen table 
i would have come . 
when you called . but . 
i had the most beautiful pale pink rose . 
its healthy stem was clenched between my teeth . and . 
i could n't answer you . still . 
my lips moved at you silently . 
they offered words you never heard . 
they screamed inside my crazed brain . only . 
it could do nothing for you . 
they blew away . and . 
they became compost in someone else 's garden . 
i bit down hard to snap its grip on me . then . 
my teeth fell out . 
they coiled their way down . 
i still held the memory of your call . and . 
my body held tight and listened . hard . 
do n't listen to me ; my heart 's been broken . 
it 's very sad , really : all my life , i 've been praised 
for my intelligence , my powers of language , of insight . 
in the end , they 're wasted- 
i never see myself , 
standing on the front steps , holding my sister 's hand . 
that 's why i ca n't account 
for the bruises on her arm , where the sleeve ends . 
in my own mind , i 'm invisible : that 's why i 'm dangerous . 
in the interest of truth . 
when i 'm quiet , that 's when the truth emerges . 
red and bright pink . 
if you want the truth , you have to close yourself 
to the older daughter , block her out : 
when a living thing is hurt like that , 
because a wound to the heart 
is also a wound to the mind . 
how you motion with hands 
being the frog husband and i burn 
your frog skin to keep you 
in the shape i prefer 
chimes you wrote in your apple 
box elegant neck 
i tried to glue the ripped 
paper back to the religious 
art but it does n't work 
making a mess of it 
we are in is a place 
frog heart 
wash towels and rags 
everything is half here , 
like the marble head 
of the roman emperor 
and the lean torso 
of his favorite . 
which does n't seem 
to touch ground does- 
we learn to walk miles 
above our bodies . 
the pig farms dissolve , 
then the small hills . 
as in dreams fraught 
the ruined set seems larger , 
a charred palace the gaze 
tunnels through 
and through . how well 
we remember the stage- 
the actors gliding about 
cooling our palms . 
not wings or singing , 
but a darkness fast as blood . 
it ended at our fingertips : 
the fence gave way 
to the forest . 
the world began . 
i say to the named granite stone , to the brown grass , 
she writes until she can not hold her pen . 
i walk the circular path , first the left side , 
then the right , casting petals to the north , 
when he leaves , i return to the center . 
i had prayed death spare you . 
you traced for me on scrap-paper ? 
i kept it for such a long time . 
a boy has scattered the petals i threw . 
the quiet hills i lift mine eyes . 
it 's the way they can not understand the window 
they buzz and buzz against , the bees that take 
a wrong turn at my door and end up thus 
in a drift at first of almost idle curiosity , 
cruising the room until they find themselves 
smack up against it and they can not fathom how 
the air has hardened and the world they know 
with their eyes keeps out of reach as , stuck there 
with all they want just in front of them , they must 
of things-this fact of glass-and can only go on 
fury to what 's impossible , feeling the sting in it . 
does the road wind up-hill all the way ? 
yes , to the very end . 
will the day 's journey take the whole long day ? 
from morn to night , my friend . 
but is there for the night a resting-place ? 
a roof for when the slow dark hours begin . 
may not the darkness hide it from my face ? 
you can not miss that inn . 
those who have gone before . 
then must i knock , or call when just in sight ? 
they will not keep you standing at that door . 
shall i find comfort , travel-sore and weak ? 
of labour you shall find the sum . 
will there be beds for me and all who seek ? 
yea , beds for all who come . 
after stumbling a long time over impossible trails 
you are up on top . 
down , climbed higher . 
that 's how you see it . after life has tossed you 
away , and you ended up on top 
like a one-legged wooden horse on a dump . 
and destiny takes on our burden : 
and the doubt always with us becomes cold dry 
rocky valleys . 
you go in the door . 
the pot lies upside down in the hearth , 
if ever the sweet spring comes , 
i 'll put aside these dead books 
along the withered boughs of old dry thoughts . 
i 'll walk out somewhere where a garden grows , 
and there i 'll stand some summer evening , 
hat beside elbows on the gray stone wall , 
and the wind will stir , coming from behind the hill . 
afterward i 'll walk home , hands behind me , 
and pause a moment before going in , 
of course , i 'll enter , but leave the door ajar , 
for someone might come in , you know , 
that a pair of eyes in the summer night 
might light a candle in the dull world , 
so softly that none might see to smile at , 
for a little heat in a cold house . 
and we by 
, do 
expose to view . 
our pride , and unclean minds , 
to an excess 
you will need to state the reason for your visit . 
do n't say because i want to walk down old roads 
and caress stone walls the color of my skin . 
you will need to state the reason for your visit . 
do n't say because the olives are ready for harvest 
press it into liquid gold . 
you will need to state the reason for your visit . 
do n't say because my parents ' house 
the green shutters my grandfather had just painted 
remain sealed shut 
you will need to state the reason for your visit . 
do n't say because i am carrying prayers in my suitcase 
for a people who wait , 
and i 'll unfold them 
and spread them out across the land . 
of the poets ; but the best . 
reader , would'st thou more have known ? 
ask his story , not this stone . 
that will speak what this ca n't tell 
of his glory . so farewell . 
and well fixed , art alone of ending not afraid . 
ere time and place were , time and place were not , 
severed from thee , its sole original , 
yet something did thy mighty power command , 
snatched men , beasts , birds , fire , air , and land . 
with form and matter , time and place did join ; 
to spoil thy peaceful realm , and ruin all thy line ; 
and to thy hungry womb drives back thy slaves again . 
into thy bosom , where truth in private lies , 
yet this of thee the wise may truly say , 
thou from the virtuous nothing dost delay , 
and to be part with thee the wicked wisely pray . 
great negative , how vainly would the wise 
is , or is not , the two great ends of fate , 
but nothing , why does something still permit 
with persons highly thought at best for nothing fit , 
and nothing there like stately nothing reigns ? 
nothing ! who dwell'st with fools in grave disguise 
the great man 's gratitude to his best friend , 
flow swiftly into thee , and in thee ever end . 
and on the seventh , he has his notes to seek . 
six days he hollows so much breath away 
in this little urn is laid 
from whose happy spark here let 
spring the purple violet . 
i think first of two sparrows i met when walking home , 
late night years ago , in another city , not unlike this - the one 
how she seemed to scream each time i swung ; how she 
parked near the opposite curb ; how , finally , i understood : 
caught in the car 's closed door , beating its whole bird 
body against it . trying , it appeared , to bang himself free . 
and who knows how long he 'd been there , wailing . who 
something between song and prayer - to do something , 
anything . and , like any good god , i disappeared . not 
indifferent , exactly . but with things to do . and , most likely , 
and say i 'm several thousand miles from home . by which 
i mean those were the days i made of everyone a love song . 
not quite it either . truth is , i did manage to find a few 
whose daughter blackened drawings with m s to mean 
the sky was full of birds the day her daddy died . i think 
his widow said he drowned one morning on a fishing trip . 
did i mention it was night ? - why i did n't even try 
to jimmy the lock to spring the sparrow , i could n't say , 
a woman to plead as deeply for me as these sparrows did , 
one for the other . no . i 'd have said something , instead , 
about the neighborhood itself , the car thief shot a block 
and a half east the week before . or about the men 
pressed to the back of the smaller , bruised and bleeding 
both . i know you thought this was about birds , 
but stay with me . i left them both in the street - 
the same street where i 'd leave the sparrows - the men 
embracing and , for all one knows ( especially one not 
from around there ) , they could have been lovers - 
the one whispering an old , old tune into the ear 
of the other -baby , baby , do n't leave me this way . i left 
the men where i 'd leave the sparrows and their song . 
and as i walked away , i heard one of the men call to me , 
please or help or brother or some such . and i did n't break 
stride , not one bit . it 's how i 've learned to save myself . 
let me try this another way . call it 1977. and say 
i 'm back west , south central los angeles . my mother 
and father at it again . but this time in the street , 
broad daylight , and all the neighbors watching . one , 
to pull my father off . you see where i 'm going with this ? 
fighting my father , fragile as a sparrow . and me , 
years later , trying to get it all down . as much for you - 
on his back , blood starting to pool and his own 
wife wailing . my mother wailing , and traffic backed , 
now , half a block . horns , whistles , and soon sirens . 
1977. summer . and all the trees full of birds . hundreds , 
i swear . and since i 'm the one writing it , i 'll tell you 
to get it down pure . to get it down exact - the animal 
and one another . stay with me now . do n't leave me . 
and in this park was a pond , and in this pond were birds . 
not sparrows , but swans . and my father spread a blanket 
my father , now sober , cursed himself for leaving the radio . 
but my mother forgave him , and said , as she caressed 
the back of his hand , that we could just listen to the swans . 
one beating its wings as it mounted the other . summer , 
1977. i listened . and watched . when my parents made love 
late into that night , i covered my ears in the next room , 
for swans is a lamentation ? and is a lamentation not 
in the street ? or what a widow might sing , learning her man 
was drowned by swans ? a lamentation of them ? imagine 
nose , and mouth each time he comes up for air . imagine 
running for help , crying to any who 'd listen . a lamentation . 
when i left my parents ' house , i never looked back . by which 
i mean i made like a god and disappeared . as when i left 
i 'll leave this city . its every flailing , its every animal song . 
the mothers ' milk , the children 's blood , 
makes me doubt if heaven will gather 
roses hence , or lilies rather . 
i have lost , and lately , these 
and the graceful use of it ; 
for to number sorrow by 
eternity is like unto a ring . 
time , like to measure , doth it self extend ; 
the ring has no beginning , middle , end . 
i look into the noise mouth paper thin 
my tongue 
a scatter 
the heat of 
brown man in lower manhattan three years later she sun rose 
my name i forget my claim this kind of fire that strikes black bodies into fever 
roads around mountains 
cause we ca n't drive 
that 's poetry 
to me . 
we were sitting there , and 
i made a joke about how 
one minute running out 
faster than the one in front 
it catches up to . 
that way , i said , 
there can be no waste . 
to come back for a few hours to 
the present subject , a painting , 
looking like it was seen , 
but it has to pay attention 
to what 's up ahead : a vision . 
therefore poetry dissolves in 
brilliant moisture and reads us 
to us . 
a faint notion . too many words , 
but precious . 
even though it 's may & amp ; the ice cream truck 
parked outside my apartment is somehow certain , 
i have a hard time believing winter is somehow , 
all of a sudden , over -the worst one of my life , 
the woman at the bank tells me . though i 'd like to be , 
it 's impossible to be prepared for everything . 
off guard today . every voice that says my name 
is a voice i do n't think i could possibly leave 
even though i think about it often , even though 
leaving is a train headed somewhere i 'd probably hate . 
perhaps it will all be worth it . even though i knew 
even then it was worth it , staying , i mean . 
even now , there is someone , somehow , waiting for me . 
for walt whitman 
we still live in an america where rotting leaves , tufts of straw , and debris are found in more homes than poetry books 
we still live in an america where america still lives in us 
love 's abstract particulars , 
while football plays on the big screen ; 
i listen like a thief in case the women know the score . 
witness is a solitary game . there is n't a thing i have left to say 
but back in my room i ring like a singing bowl , 
empty and unable to stop . 
you 're in nine kinds of pain , my friend ; you know 
the twenty-seven strains of despair . and your lovely hair has fallen . 
the world was always someone else 's oyster , a metaphor 
all i 'm good for tonight 
is to let the night pass , 
the sun slides down behind brick dust , 
today 's angle of life . everything 
shaped into dry air 
men unable to catch sparrows without breaking 
wings into splinters . blues-horn 
but the white odor of absence . 
the big iron ball 
swings , keeping time 
as black feathers 
parking lots . 
in your arms 
enough to be 
in your arms 
careful as we had to be at times 
in my hand , 
or my wrist , 
the center of attention , 
placed , frail identity 
as if our someday-newborn 
on your chest- 
in your arms 
often enough , it was 
in that stillness , the only stillness 
of the illness , all the work 
we had yet to do , had just done , 
we had to pump 
from nothing , really , 
from our pinched and tiny minds 
just the idea of hope 
make it from scratch , air and water 
the severe concentration 
of that , the repetition of that 
lifted for a moment 
just above your arms 
it weighed down 
but remained above 
like a cathedral ceiling , 
while i held tightly 
while there i could 
in your arms 
only there , the only stillness 
remember the will , 
you do n't need reasons to live 
one reason , blinking in the fog , 
it is , it was 
in your arms 
my childhood was not an anxious place , 
though i lay 
my sheets like beads , wondering when the sun 
they that chased their own tail 
around this water bowl 
we call earth . when i was a child , 
we practiced a type of 
called duck and cover , 
where we huddled 
under desks in case of a nuclear 
had the bomb , and were evil 
from the small grave 
of a tv screen . 
and america is still scared of 
now the american dream is to be debt free , 
which i am not , nor may ever be , but at least 
useless ! useless !

translated from the german 
this is what it 's like : 
you sit in the white room 
singular , knees together 
arms over your head 
to break the noise from the radio 
that is false as a drunk 's promise 
to loan you his car next week . 
of course next week never comes 
but some are ready for the real story 
the young man involved breaks her tired heart 
broken dishes , wrecked cars . 
few know so many friends alive as dead ; 
join night to day , and sunday to the week , 
our very joys are anxious , and expire 
i swallow a pill but there is no cure 
a city map wo n't get me where i want to go 
mindless of the mall , 
i crawl outside these vacant blues 
and into the contours of your eyes 
is n't here any more . 
all done with seeing her fat little form 
burst out of the basement door ; 
and with seeing her african son-in-law 
with his great white strong cold squares of teeth 
and his little eyes of stone ; 
and with seeing the squat fat daughter 
letting in the men 
when majesty has gone for the day- 
and letting them out again . 
he went flying down the river in his boat 
with his video camera to his eye , making 
a moving picture of the moving river 
upon which his sleek boat moved swiftly 
toward the end of his vacation . he showed 
his vacation to his camera , which pictured it , 
the sky , the light , the bow of his rushing boat 
behind which he stood with his camera 
so that after he had had it he would still 
have it . it would be there . with a flick 
of a switch , there it would be . but he 
would not be in it . he would never be in it . 
the house is so quiet now 
its bag limp as a stopped lung , its mouth 
grinning into the floor , maybe at my 
i 've lived this way long enough , 
but when my old woman died her soul 
went into that vacuum cleaner , and i ca n't bear 
to see the bag swell like a belly , eating the dust 
because there is old filth everywhere 
she used to crawl , in the corner and under the stair . 
i know now how life is cheap as dirt , 
and still the hungry , angry heart 
hangs on and howls , biting at air . 
the bright white of a well-tailored 
shirt , you got those loose-as-sacks 
and you know , whether you are looking 
like money , or about to take a stroll , 
to tilt that hat like you own 
the world ; yeah , smoke your pipe , 
roll your tobacco , and hold loose 
as authority , your muscles , lithe 
and hard ; and every so often , when 
you feel the urge , you reach into the waist 
pocket and pull out that watch on its 
chain , then look in the sky and say 
gon na be a cold one when it come , 
like god gave you that fancy clock 
to tell the future . these are the easy 
what is out of frame to happen : 
of the world . waiting , with such delicate 
fly , if thy freedom thou'dst maintain , 
alas ! i feel th'advice is vain ! 
a heart , whose safety but in flight does lie , 
is too far lost to have the power to fly .

that filled up the evening 
until some things could be said . it was a made-up 
situation in which lives could be lost . 
whatever that was now grows inside 
causing pieces of paper we hold 
in our hands to appear 
and disappear . all i ask 
is to take me away from this place , 
to another place , very much like 
this place , where we can meet 
and six months later 
be married . you laughed and went with me .

at the same time hard , like the beak

cherry plums suck a week 's soak , 
overnight they explode into the scenery of before 
your touch . the curtains open on the end of our past . 
them through another tongue as the first year of our 
decks of the cliffs . they take another turn 
on the spiral of life where the blossoms 
blush & amp ; pale in a day of dirty dawn 
where the ghost of you webs 
your limbs through branches 
of cherry plum . rare bird , 
extinct color , you stay in 
my dreams in x-ray . in 
folds and layers the 
shedding petals of 
my grief into a 
for ever 
art . 
too high , too high to pluck 
my heart shall swing . 
a fruit no bee shall suck , 
if on some night of cold 
it falls to ground 
in apple-leaves of gold 
i 'll wrap it round . 
and i shall seal it up 
with spice and salt , 
in a deep vault . 
before my eyes are blind 
and my lips mute , 
i must eat core and rind 
of that same fruit . 
before my heart is dust 
at the end of all , 
eat it i must , i must 
were it bitter gall . 
but i shall keep it sweet 
by some strange art ; 
wild honey i shall eat 
when i eat my heart . 
o honey cool and chaste 
as clover 's breath ! 
sweet heaven i shall taste 
before my death . 
pays tribute since our love began , 
let me embrace , embracing you , 
beauty of other shape and hue , 
odd glinting graces of which none 
shone more than candle to your sun ; 
smile your forgiveness : each bright ghost 
dives in love 's glory and is lost 
slipped , maybe , from some kid 's wrist 
or a rushed lover 's empty front seat 
through a half-cracked car window- 
toward today 's gray mess of clouds , 
trailing its gold ribbon like lightning 
that will never strike anything 
or anyone here on the forsaken ground , 
riding swift currents toward the horizon , 
custom , whose laws we all allow , 
and bow before his shrine , 
are now my valentine . 
ah , could my humble muse aspire 
to catch the flame divine ! 
these are the gifts that i 'd require 
for thee , my valentine ! 
may truth and wisdom ever guide 
and guard my valentine . 
her influence divine 
shed on thy head , and ever lead , 
and bless my valentine . 
life 's dangerous paths safe may'st thou tread , 
think on my valentine ! 
valentine , valentine you arrive 
like a recess of paper vanity , litter , old 
with red-rimmed `` loves , '' red-rhymed lies in lace . 
the verses come , rising as easily as long-stemmed snakes in 
winter , almost skipping february . 
sad . and it comes 
tomorrow . again , gray , the streaks 
of work 
of the pavement , dissolving 
with the idea 
and out of 
hearing . though the day 
come to us 
in waves , 
sun , air , the beat 
of the clock . 
world , 
wishing it would stand still . 
tell me , 
and i gain at the telling . 
of the lie , and the waking 
against the heavy breathing 
of new light , dawn , shattering 
of feeling . 
what is tomorrow 
that it can not come 
today ? 
where the people did not dwell ; 
they had gone unto the wars , 
nightly , from their azure towers , 
to keep watch above the flowers , 
in the midst of which all day 
nothing there is motionless- 
over the magic solitude . 
ah , by no wind are stirred those trees 
ah , by no wind those clouds are driven 
over the violets there that lie 
in myriad types of the human eye- 
over the lilies there that wave 
and weep above a nameless grave ! 
they wave : -from out their fragrant tops 
they weep : -from off their delicate stems 
of the ground ; every critic had his explanation 
or hers . but-we had to remember-they 
came to nothing , every one ; those large stones 
out of the earth served the systems 
of those who considered them , as explaining 
something about the past it was important 
no one had any idea truly ; there was no 
they remained like their origins-or like 
once , there was a year where every romance 
soon , they were on the television . later , the sidewalks . 
how do they wash them ? i asked.they do n't , 
my friend said.it 's part of what keeps them so dark and stiff . 
an entire generation has arrived dark and stiff . unlike 
little house on the prairie . sweet , blind mary 
to drive them to the theater where they burst 
into dollars and popcorn in their seats . they want the car 
and younger.cha-ching . is there nothing anyone can do ? 
a battle lost in the cornfields 
and in the sky a victory . 
birds , the sun and birds again . 
by night , what will be left of me ? 
by night , only a row of lamps , 
a wall of yellow clay that shines , 
and down the garden , through the trees , 
like candles in a row , the panes ; 
there i dwelt once and dwell no longer- 
i ca n't live where i once lived , though 
the roof there used to cover me . 
lord , you covered me long ago . 
little patches of grass disappear 
who slip into the spruce . 
cars collapse into parts . 
spring dissolves into summer , 
the kitten into the cat . 
when i think of all those 
i feel a ripple of extinction 
and blow a smoke ring through the trees . 
soon there will be nothing left here but sky . 
when i think about the fact 
i am not thinking about you 
it is a new way of thinking about you . 
tree with white bags tied around random apples . the apples 
remind you of clouds , how each hangs in the sky , singular 
sum of its parts . after your first glimpse , you are lonely for 
missing . they are in a refrigerator in washington , d.c . 
pain . and his words and songs and prayers and curses he 
will never speak are an empty set . 
do n't get me wrong : i know 
that knowledge is power , 
that mystery 's water , 
that hunger makes 
lover , 
and yes , i 've drunk 
from the echo of 
and yet , 
alas , 
here i be , 
on song and love , 
hard as rails 
and light as air , 
expecting the heavens 
to throw down a flare , 
to burn a bush , 
strike up the sea , 
that might mean 
have noticed me . 
too weak to ring and glad of it , 
thinking it best to observe us quietly 
before flying in , and who knows if he will find 
the way out ? cautious of traps , this one . 
a winged cross , plain , the body straight 
that could kill us with mercury if our teeth 
did not respect its brittle body . slim as an eel 
or weapons , and wings clear and small as a wish 
to see over our heads , to see the whole picture . 
and steps forth , polished black , with two 
at the edge of its eyes .

at the edge of its eyes . 
the old watch : their 
thick eyes 
trailed by the beginnings of necks , 
shiver , 
in the frog pond 
i hear its drone , drifting , high up 
and i hear , 
coming over the hills , america singing , 
tv going on about the smells of the human body , 
the rice of the world , 
wearing a few shadows 
walk down a dirt road , smashed 
flesh thrown down in the sunshine 
dogs shall eat 
and flesh flung into the air 
shall be seized by birds , 
the drifting sun that gives us our lives . 
i worry much about the suffering 
his mother across the border from spain to france 
holding his last few years of poetry . 
the french fed him but could n't save him . 
there 's no true path to a death - 
we discover the path by walking . 
we turn a corner on no road 
and there 's a house on a green hill 
are the poems in the basement of the house on the hill ? 
we 'll find out if we remember earth at all . 
i chopped down the house that you had been saving to live in next 
summer . 
i am sorry , but it was morning , and i had nothing to do 
and its wooden beams were so inviting . 
forgive me . i simply do not know what i am doing . 
i gave away the money that you had been saving to live on for the next ten 
years . 
last evening we went dancing and i broke your leg . 
forgive me . i was clumsy , and 
and move and hold back 
and fall like a person hit by sleep 
arriving at the place without light 
and fall like a dead body falls 
and find there the great enemy 
and come to a tower all of stones 
such that through it the earth opens 
even up there water is pouring out 
and each and every vapor spent 
over winning and not losing 
in which it stands caught out 
filling our view 
after the steaming bodies swept 
through the hungry streets of swollen cities ; 
of increase and multiply , made 
i woke to a landscape of sunshine where 
maps trace out no alibis-stepped 
into a morning of naked truth , 
where acts mean what they really are : 
the purity of loving 
for the sake of love . 
butterflies in lamplight are moving as they move . 
long ahead , and nothing 's driven back to the stern 
since to go with this motion is to be moored in port . 
speed , till one ball , by falling , flies , by flying , falls . 
and rides it motionless to an impossible shore 
the other staying home , meet again after years , 
each to the other younger from when he left . 
you , who chose two ways equally at once , circuit 
your morning masses before library and lab . 
in your life 's chosen box , this con-celebration . 
there was a frozen tree that i wanted to paint 
but the shells came down 
at 3:30 in the morning , 
and i went out to live with the rats 
but the lights were too bright 
and i thought maybe i 'd better go back and sit in a 
poetry class : 
is hell ; 
the cross sits like a fly on my window , 
my mother 's breath stirs small leaves 
in my mind ; 
and i pulled a letter from my pocket and read it 
sleep with pound , she 's trying to tell me that h.d . 
and someday we 'll all go home 
together . 
in fact , he said , this is as far 
as we go . 
so i let him have it ; old withered whore of time 
your breasts taste the sour cream of dreaming . . . 
he let me out 
in the middle of the desert ; 
to die is to die is to die , 
magazines in with the onions . . . 
an old ford picked me up 
and , this time , 
i kept my mouth 
shut . 
where trees grow beards of moss , 
still , you prefer the vegetable air 
to almost any other place on the map . 
after the heart attack , 
you considered paris- 
but decided you had no use for glory , 
with statues and expensive trees . 
you admit , on the whole , 
the towns in this country are ugly . 
( a beautiful name that became your destination ) , 
expecting a fragrant town of mango trees 
but found cattle grazing in the plaza , 
rattling the tin plates 
that 's perhaps why you like it , 
it 's a country you ca n't count on , 
unable to take root in the mud , 
creating neither factory nor industry 
but a thirst for soda pop ; 
it is skin deep . 
the clock is stuck in the rain 
and the mud of four o'clock . 
there 's nothing to do but wait as if 
in a dry cave , a room with a view of the waterfall , 
pinned as you are beneath the downpour . 
the waiter bends over your cup 
without filling it , 
leaves the streets and the gutters , 
the balcony and the air greener , heavier- 
powdered with a sea-green lichen , 
resembles old bronze , 
( a pink and crumbling building 
surrounded by dusty rose trees ) 
prints more money to prop 
the flimsy flowered currency . 
dollars will bring by morning . 
in the hotel restaurant 
offering you one the day 
his social security arrives . 
have crawled through the cracks 
a place to start from scratch . 
they thrive in the vegetable air . 
you wonder how you 'll survive , 
you 've stayed in the trees , 
a dreamer , all your life , 
even now wanting to believe 
a change of scenery 
will get you back on your feet . 
tonight , you walk along the damp streets , 
an average steak , a glass of wine 
to your small room wedged between 
there are so many things you ca n't change- 
like the dull thrashing music . 
silence . the click of the tape . 
rising like the moon , 
lifts you out of yourself , 
where , for a moment , you travel light . 
in this low place between mountains 
fog settles with the dark of evening . 
every year it takes some of those 
on the way home from a dance , or 
a father on his way to the paper mill , 
each morning , up on the ridge , 
the sun lifts this veil , sees what night 
has accomplished . the water on our window- 
screens disappears slowly , gradually , 
like grief . the heat of the day carries water 
from the river back up into the sky , 
longest , you 'll see the lines it leaves 
on trees , the flowers that grow 
when the tide lay under the clouds 
of an afternoon and gave them back to themselves 
i used to sit and drink at the very edge of it , 
of the tables , resting there like clarity 
itself , you might think , 
right where you could put a hand to it . 
as drink gave way to drink , the slow 
through which one at last saw the skeleton 
of everything , stripped of any sense or consequence , 
brightness you might see 
or placing a blazing credit card on a plastic tray 
and you 'd know . you would know goddamn it . and never be able to say . 
but inside her , there is always velvet , 
velvet with its give and yield , the kind you 
find at a pet store , a bin full of long 
among the cedar chips and their eyes 
opening wide as if rabbits could n't know 
what softness brings , as if they 'd never know 
the smell of something long stored away now 
brought into light , and now too her mother 
with a camera pointing at her , red 
child on the lap of the easter rabbit , 
softness of the body hiding inside 
the costume , eyes glinting from the wide holes 
in the mask , not a single sobbing breath 
the bird dog lifts his ears to the sound 
of velvet , the girl listens to the drawn 
cries of a crow , her father walks 
with the silence of the shotgun , waiting 
at the end of it blinking , its wide eyes 
velvet settling , laid over lines , drying 
across the ceiling of an uncle 's garage 
where they talk inside the smell of salted 
he says , and they scream like children when , 
the club down on their heads , saving 
their feet for cheap key chains , for luck 
that softness does n't seem to have inside 
of cages , chicken wire , tubes of water , 
and sometimes boys who try kicking the cage 
around to see what happens to velvet 
tumbling . and , in the after quiet , 
she bites the hands reaching toward her , so they 
stone her , they open her belly and pull 
eye and groan at the fluid inside . then they 
bury the carcass without thinking first 
of washing their sticky hands in the sink 
before eating dinner , before setting 
the table , in the still softness of her 
the rabbit 's eyes dull with scratches , eyes left 
behind on her bed at night when she stands 
in the hall , hearing her father breathe in his room 
off the sheets . awake from a fluid dream 
of a woman 's eyes staring from behind 
around her , naked , bald . and a man 's 
voice said , this is your rabbit , so she woke 
to this dream inside her , with his teeth wrapped 
in her hair , and his hands inside her thighs 
as velvet only listens and is quiet . 
gives joy only if read in a broken rhythm , pausing 
what : a pity to die my love . to say : `` i do n't love you anymore '' 
the distance between the first passionate whisper and this new 
beneath the very expanse you created . 
the : expanse . is : a cloth . is : white . is : a sheet . 
is : a land on which snow has fallen . 
for the dead , as is proper for seed . and . for lilies yet to sprout . 
you 'll feel something like moving scratches : those are birds mice my 
stripped of your gifts in this tomb where i ca n't grieve for you 
but can only dig down to the earth down to its iron 
what am i to think now , 
of her bottom 
down the half-flight 
carpet stair 
to the bathroom ? 
what am i to do 
i put all my doubt 
to the mouth of her long body , 
let her draw the night 
out of me like a thorn . 
she touched it , and it moved : that 's all . 
sometimes i dream what 's called the 
male dream 
i 'm going somewhere not too far away , i 'm almost there , 
but then another , and another , as i get farther and farther 
however close you are to where you want to go , the compound 
until you dead-end at a small canal that 's nowhere on your map . 
of some fantasy that lay beneath the placid surface of the day , 
the remnants of some dream so many people had to die for . instead , 
above an unreal city floating on the water . we 're sure at first 
that something lies beyond the facts and books , but then we realize it is n't there . 
whatever lay behind the slaughter was n't in the world , 
existing merely in the heart , in memory , in someone 's imagination , 
come , holy spirit , 
bending or not bending the grasses , 
appearing or not above our heads in a tongue of flame , 
at hay harvest or when they plough in the orchards or when snow 
i am only a man : i need visible signs . 
many a time i asked , you know it well , that the statue in church 
lifts its hand , only once , just once , for me . 
but i understand that signs must be human , 
therefore call one man , anywhere on earth , 
not me-after all i have some decency- 
and allow me , when i look at him , to marvel at you . 
creator spirit , by whose aid 
come , pour thy joys on human kind ; 
from sin , and sorrow set us free ; 
and make thy temples worthy thee . 
rich in thy sev'n-fold energy ! 
thou strength of his almighty hand , 
whose pow'r does heav'n and earth command : 
submit the senses to the soul ; 
then , lay thy hand , and hold 'em down . 
and , lest our feet should step astray , 
protect , and guide us in the way . 
make us eternal truths receive , 
give us thy self , that we may see 
the father and the son , by thee . 
immortal honour , endless fame , 
attend th ' almighty father 's name : 
who for lost man 's redemption died : 
and equal adoration be , 
on the train , i thought 
by light : 
chrome-winged birds 
that first day 
that made the harbor 
later i learned to live in it , 
to walk 
through the alien city- 
with fierce light 
clinging to my head and hands . 
treated as gently as every 
other guest- 
each house 's barbed antennae 
of weather- 
with the last 
i ca n't 
stand this , which 
one of us do you love ? 
had split the day in two , 
and now we went 
on the edge of the afternoon 
made of faded blue duck . 
we went like a wandering 
pull by pull between 
the leafy cotton plants , 
at the end of the furrow . 
but we always arrived 
in a rush to get there , 
and the sole logic was 
we had to move over 
to the next furrow , 
and no one could stop 
and i , the dusty kid 
left behind in the middle of the field , 
held prisoner in my own slow shadow , 
was right 
in not giving in to the absurd pace 
of tradition . 
so my days burned up 
in that captive state 
of childhood . 
then , yes , 
after noon , 
the body finally lying down 
in the waves of the aluminum bathtub . 
i could shed 
the muddy waters of time . 
so it was , 
i exiled myself each time 
from what i was . 
death is coming 
to take you to venus . 
a flashlight coil , 
a penny , the cat 's bell , 
mom 's charm bracelet . 
they say that planet is torment , 
whipped by circular wind , 
but no . when you get there 
it is a light in the sky 
and i am with you . 
if you find nothing else , 
of a winter moth , 
lighter than dust . 
she sat on his lap for hours 
pressed his face to her 
large pink breasts her hands 
moved through his hair 
like fond snakes 
she gave him curls , cleft 
hooves beneath the flesh 
yet none the less immortal , breathing on . 
as when she guided once her dove-drawn car , - 
but at her feet a pale , death-stricken jew , 
wept ! here still he weeps anew , 
nor ever shall his shadow lift or move , 
while mourns one ardent heart , one poet-brain , 
by the dragon-sharp islands , 
it then brushed clean as sand . 
looked to the window casting her light , 
she could have seen almost to land 's end , 
flashing its glassy code for tears 
back to shore , seen almost to the cage on deck , 
the pigeons gray as the mind , 
some to bear messages home the first days out , 
to come and waste their time and ours : perhaps 
you 'd care to join us ? 
dormant are wild animals and that tribe of bees 
and monsters out of the sea 's dark syntax ; 
is stripped away 
but you are held under water . 
in this poem you enter a mirrored dressing room 
lit so that you look more beautiful than you have ever looked . 
i recognize you with surprise . 
in this poem you are by yourself . 
as a snow globe , going nowhere in circles 
but not lost , not bereft as the wood 
as in whirling round , swimming in the head , 
like an elevator into the earth , falling 
crack , a loose screw , a lost way.disordered 
as in death lasts , my brother 's not coming back . 
the spin of it continuous as in looking down 
from height , and then it stops , the spinning 
the world is the same , but it is n't . the tipped 
views of trees when hanging from your knees . 
after d.h.l . 
your first thought when the light snaps on and the black wings 
clatter about the kitchen is a bat 
does not consider knows only to startle 
clearly not a bat but a moth and harmless 
still you are shy of it it clings to the hood of the stove 
how could you kill it where would you hide the body 
a creature so solid must have room for a soul 
and if this is so why not in a creature 
half its size or half its size again and so on 
down to the ants clearly it must be saved 
caught in a shopping bag and rushed to the front door 
afraid to crush it feeling the plastic rattle 
throwing fitful shadows around the landing 
who has watched your whole performance with a smile 
the half-compassion and half-horror we feel for the creatures 
we want not to hurt and prefer not to touch 
i seem to wake 
to feel on the brink of something 
that does n't end , beauty 
that is more than beautiful , 
meaning that is more . 
the present is all around me , dreams , 
memory made of clouds , camels , 
of somewhere within and beyond this world . 
here 's light , 
birds fly up , perch on branches , 
peck seed from the grass , ( tug worms from the soil ) . 
i am not what i imagined , 
making the angels disappear , wishing them back again . 
once were true : 
a virgin birth , a resurrection , 
it drags them out , 
but blue and green . 
as necessity and chance , 
where the eyes should be , 
as different from the others 
no better than a rat , 
nothing can follow that . 
something will . blunt heads of rain , 
faithless wind , 
the stricken sun at dusk , 
of making love face to face , 
a man and a woman pretend to be white ice 
three men at the lavender door are closed in by the storm 
beyond the black valley . that means or then you know 
you 're in a big cloud of it , it 's brilliant white mid-february 
come in for three minutes , then bye-bye like a gold watch left on the 
or part of the sum of what big white families think up 
company . 
to turn it down and laugh in the face of the fearful white storm 
or picture it brilliant blue for a further sunday memory 
refusing a big pink kiss , you burned the sunday sauce 
of crushed red tomatoes , you turn it down to just an orange glow . 
in the future , i imitate an imagined trumpet sound 
or the brilliant purple words of a man or woman i have n't met yet 
or perhaps it 's a grey-haired man i already know who said some- 
thing yesterday 
to a mutual friend who will give me the whole story in black and 
white tomorrow 
go to work to push away the rest of the white snow that will fall 
tonight . 
in your extended absence , you permit me 
the heavy rains , the cold nights that come 
so often here , while other regions get 
twelve weeks of summer . all this 
belongs to you : on the other hand , 
i planted the seeds , i watched the first shoots 
like wings tearing the soil , and it was my heart 
broken by the blight , the black spot so quickly 
you have a heart , in our understanding of 
between the dead and the living , who are , in consequence , 
how much terror we bear , the spotted leaf , 
the red leaves of the maple falling 
even in august , in early darkness : i am responsible 
for these vines . 
once i believed in you ; i planted a fig tree . 
of no summer . it was a test : if the tree lived , 
it would mean you existed . 
by this logic , you do not exist . or you exist 
where are grown the unimaginable 
the hem of your garment . i have to discipline myself 
if there is justice in some other world , those 
like myself , whom nature forces 
the lion 's share of all things , all 
objects of hunger , greed being 
praise of you . and no one praises 
painfully checked desire , or more deserves 
which does not travel . 
should n't it ache , this slit 
into the sweet 
and salt mix of waters 
winged open : yellow- 
around the tough 
his knife to make 
from the oyster 's 
mantle - its thread of red 
than a seed 
flesh . both hosts eased 
open with a knife 
( as if anything 
could be said to be eased 
with a knife ) : 
so that one pearl 
after another can be 
added to others 
until a single rope is strung 
on silk . linked 
by what you think 
is pain . nothing 
handled and yet feel 
so little , your pity 
turned into part of this 
with your small , 
four-chambered heart , 
could be so precious 
another to keep it 
close ? imagine 
the weeks it takes to wind 
seed placed at the other 
heart 's mantle . 
become what no one 
wants to : 
into making us 
the thing we want 
to call beautiful . 
from more intimate speech , 
especially now , at the end of the world ? 
ca n't we begin a conversation 
then gradually move it inside ? 
what holds us back 
we 've killed the earth . 
yet we speak of other things . 
all wounds to the truth . 
my father came down not killed 
for whom he 'd worn a uniform , 
and he lived a long afterward , 
i called after him many times , surprised 
when i heard the catch in my own voice . 
of listening to someone else speak of 
what he 'd seen and survived . 
he himself closed his own 
mouth against his own words . 
in the wrong sequence , his spirit , 
then his mind , and last his body 
i think he was carried like a leaf 
with minerals that steadily replaced 
an ex-soldier , to leaf-delicate stone inscribed 
his army jacket bore the white rectangle 
of one who has torn off his name . he sat mute 
they had the look of men who held their breath 
and now their tongues . what is to say 
beyond that said by the fathers who bent lower 
and lower as the war went on , spines curving 
of enemy flesh and blood . now these who survived , 
who got back in cargo planes emptied at the front , 
strung through tin cans . better an alarm 
than the constant nightmare of something moving 
on its belly to make your skin crawl 
i grew up in a big house 
deserved punishment . 
with the grease of yesterday 's glories , 
a thick grease collected under arctic skies . 
smoke . 
that 's when we saw each other clearly . 
or rather , what remained of us . 
scratched away with a blade . 
how different we were ! 
those with round faces were righteous ; 
those with narrow faces were cautious . 
another to silence , the music 's music . 
inside a ten-by-ten-foot cell 
he had built for himself . 
and the mysterious one 
but how similar we were in severe circumstances ! 
that the smallest stone sends into the sky 
toward the mouth of the abyss . 
then it became obvious there was n't enough space for everyone . 
telling of what they knew , what they witnessed , 
and so , through their narrative , 
creating their own grease . 
the others crossed over the ocean . 
and those in particular who went farthest away 
of wretched survival , burying it 
in the darkest crevices on their being . 
lingers there for much , much longer . 
the woman whose face has just finished breaking 
with a joy so infinite 
and heavy that it might be grief has won 
for an expanse of souls that washes from a million 
picture tubes onto the blank reaches 
of the air . meanwhile , the screams are packing 
the audience will no longer move , will be caught 
out the double-cross within the terrible progress 
with loneliness , repeating to this woman 's 
only face , this time , again , i have not won . 
my girlfriend is a miracle . 
she 's so young but she 's so beautiful . 
now there 's a word you have n't heard for a while . 
it makes me smile . 
it 's spring on broadway , and in the center strip mall 
the trees are all 
excited to be beginning . 
of display today-osama bin laden is dead ! 
one shot to the chest and one to the head , 
seal team 6 far away from my bed 
bullets beyond compare 
flew over there , 
flew through the air 
to above and below the beard of hair , 
the brains out the nose . our vietnam 
above her parade . 
all hail the crumbling stone monument 
long rotted and burned , the short walk to the river , 
where we can bathe in its brown , 
for weeks . in winter , eagles 
dive here , gathering lift when the wind 
and likes to rent her movies , for a treat . 
it makes some evenings harder to enjoy . 
him as their slave is too long to repeat . 
it makes some evenings harder to enjoy . 
i would n't say my life is incomplete , 
but some evening i could certainly enjoy 
i guess , though , we were destined not to meet . 
which makes some evenings harder to enjoy . 
they are weighing the babies again on color television . 
for years we have watched them , back-lit by the desert , 
and the drought has grown worse with the gradual increase in herds 
this , says the voice , can be laid to the natural greed 
which means ( a slow pan of the sand ) that the water table has dropped . 
with those who are starving to death in a distant nation 
that waits for too little dried milk , white rice , trash fish . 
look into our living rooms and the shaded rooms we sleep in . 
it does n't matter 
a damn what 's playing- 
in the dead of winter 
you go , days of 1978- 
because the soldiers were beautiful 
in the hopeless war 
i did not go to in the end 
because it ended . 
the 20 
century ? 
it was a war 
between peasants on the one side , 
but is not consumed . 
his movie never ends . 
it will be beautiful 
every winter of our lives , my love , 
and the wounds are a jungle . 
equally , no matter when their movies end , 
that 's all . 
there has never been a president of the united states . 
century ? 
no battle at all because the peasants 
have gone away far 
into the lost traveler 's dream , 
it burns all winter long . 
he never tires of it 
and for good reason : 
every face of the flames is doomed and beautiful ; 
every spark that shoots out into the freezing air 
is god 's truth 
given us all over again 
in the bitter weather of men 's 
a president of the united states . 
there has never been a just war . 
there has never been any life 
until now if now is no dream but an asia . 
i dreamt half my life was spent 
i forgot i was ever there . 
red-tailed hawk turning 
resistance into ecstasy . 
whose butt seemed glued to the sidewalk . 
pink as a lover 's present . 
and tilting my bamboo umbrella 
against the warm slant 
crossing the great bay on a bridge that began 
who knows when , and will end 
who knows when ? 
i thought you had a summer home 
pictures of you in front of la 
father had money . 
so maybe that 's why 
when i first met you i did n't know 
what to say , someone too 
worldly to have 
anything to learn from me . 
then there was your 
halloween party where i 
managed not to be in any 
of the photos . perhaps it was for 
the best . 
upstairs , on a couch i 'll never sit 
on again , an image of us has 
are on screen , and you , 
nervous because all your other 
guests left us alone . 
nothing happened . 
at least for another year or so . 
sometimes it 's hard to guess 
how long film needs to be 
exposed . i wanted to get 
the colors right . 
tonight we will function like women . 
i clasp my sister 's tiny hand . 
we will not turn away 
though spring , spring with its black appetite , 
the lion was sad . he suffered us 
to touch him . when i placed the bread of my hands 
that the world outside this world 
is all vinegar and gall , that to be a young girl at the foot of a god 
i will remember her as the woman 
who grins with her wrists . from my thicket of heather 
i can not stop it . i can not stop it just as in that other place 
i could not keep the planes with their spiked fires from coming . 
i have nothing but my hands to use 
my hands must suffice . 
like pieces of money . in the moon 's milk light 
there will be women like us who choose to . 
vigil strange i kept on the field one night ; 
one look i but gave which your dear eyes return 'd with a look i shall never forget , 
one touch of your hand to mine o boy , reach 'd up as you lay on the ground , 
then onward i sped in the battle , the even-contested battle , 
vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night , 
but not a tear fell , not even a long-drawn sigh , long , long i gazed , 
passing sweet hours , immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade-not a tear , not a word , 
vigil of silence , love and death , vigil for you my son and my soldier , 
vigil final for you brave boy , ( i could not save you , swift was your death , 
till at latest lingering of the night , indeed just as the dawn appear 'd , 
ending my vigil strange with that , vigil of night and battle-field dim , 
i rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket , 
and buried him where he fell . 
because he was as hard to handle 
go somewhere dark and hold a candle 
the reverse 
thanks to my stars , i prize the sweets of life , 
no sleepless nights i count , no days of strife . 
i rest , i wake , i drink , i sometimes love , 
content to live , content to die unknown , 
the yellow years have gathered fast : 
long centuries have come and gone . 
and yet ( they say ) the place will don 
a phantom fury of the past , 
trembled and swayed with rapture vast 
( long centuries have come and gone ) , 
this ancient plain , when night comes on , 
shakes to a ghostly battle-blast , 
the glory of greek shame was cast : 
long centuries have come and gone , 
the first has fallen to the last : - 
long centuries have come and gone . 
that we take our rest at the end of the grove 
nestled into our portion beneath the bird 's migration

or if you can indeed hear what i might say 
heal me and grant me laughter 's bounty 
of eyes and smiles , of eyes and affection .

what was needed was a circuit , 
what 's within is without being seen 
to be so . 
four left 's a square . 
one way turning system 
until it becomes its other way .

but the way of its expression 
requires hurt and then , treatment 
of skin for leather clothes or whatever , 
it 's old , sometimes , often . 
depending on the question , it can be 
the answer . 
one should n't be proud to not 
have it .

then a last one , a fourth .

i scrubbed like a crazy woman 
and here they come off the line , little black 
stripes wherever i 'd pinned them up 
or hung them over-coal dust settles 
on the clothesline , piles up 
like a line of snow on a tree branch . 
after that , i wiped down the clothesline 
every time , but no matter , you ca n't 
with black and gray lines , 
i thought i 'd die that first week 
when i seen him walk off to the mine , 
black , burnt-looking marks 
on his shirt over his shoulders , right 
where wings would of folded . 
it was a matter of wearing gloves well 
silence has come to see what no one sees , 
it 's always grim at the start of the play . 
friends of our late friend are minor-leaguers 
never to be called up but good as types , 
yesterday , books were thrown from the third floor , 
out the window , they sank in pairs like shoes , 
and i watch violet swords on a white shore , 
blade-tip laid across blade-tip , where it snows . 
down in a green and shady bed , 
a modest violet grew , 
its stalk was bent , it hung its head , 
as if to hide from view . 
and yet it was a lovely flower , 
its colours bright and fair ; 
instead of hiding there , 
yet there it was content to bloom , 
within the silent shade . 
then let me to the valley go , 
this pretty flower to see ; 
that i may also learn to grow 
in sweet humility . 
a black satin purse in her right hand , 
all night , thunder and rain 
in a flash of lightning , his hands visible , 
they talk in near dark , eating from a basket . 
she places her hand in his lap , 
opens her legs as if god came from her , 
all night , his tongue like a fish 
now the bridge is illuminated , twin 
near the open window , dark of leaves . 
outside at dawn , the sun hidden , 
crosses before windows as gold as rome . 
the telephone , her mouth open . 
i can see all the way into you , he says . 
is touched with what reality we feel , 
whose timeless motion flesh must so conceal ; 
and might pretend to gather from her eyes 
the final motion flesh gives up to art . 
but slowly , if we watch her long enough , 
into a space too dim with time and blood 
for our set eyes to follow true enough , 
or nerves to guess about her , if they would . 
one must be brave to live through 
a day . what remains 
is nothing but the pleasure of longing-very precious . 
as work 
who will never 
stop running . and this 
gives him endurance . 
it is like a window 
on a high tower , through which 
blows the wind of strength . 
longing , 
sweet day , so cool , so calm , so bright , 
the dew shall weep thy fall to-night , 
for thou must die . 
sweet rose , whose hue angry and brave 
thy root is ever in its grave , 
and thou must die . 
sweet spring , full of sweet days and roses , 
my music shows ye have your closes , 
and all must die . 
only a sweet and virtuous soul , 
like season 'd timber , never gives ; 
but though the whole world turn to coal , 
i wish my frank and open face 
held just one tiny little trace 
of something that approaches guile . 
and heavy-lidded eyes instead 
in memory of my parents 
people whose lives have been shaped 
by history-and it is always tragic- 
do not want to talk about it , 
would rather dance , give parties 
on thrift-shop china . you feel 
wonderful in their homes , 
on the road into exile . 
the words start over again 
hold no terror for them . 
it 's when you 're not looking . 
to tame their nightmares , they choose 
swallow the flames in the sunset sky , 
in their elegant tiger suits . 
cover your eyes : there 's one 
walking on a thread 
thirty feet above us- 
shivering points of light 
leap across her body , 
and she works without a net . 
i have not walked on common ground , 
nor drunk of earthly streams ; 
moves softly through my dreams . 
he makes the air so keen and strange , 
the rocks of time , the tides of change , 
are nothing in his sight . 
death lays no shadow on his smile ; 
life is a race fore-run ; 
look in his face a little while , 
and life and death are one . 
spread their halo of leaves 
over two or three red-slatted benches . 
into a hall full of dull gold scenes 
so it 's not that the sun has come out , it 's 
something to do with the leaves and painting 
in the realm of echoes where footsteps 
shedding their gold leaf onto the pavement 
who is staring out of the window 
they pass before me one by one riding on animals 
`` what are you waiting for , '' they want to know 
i know 
the forest is there , i 've lived in it 
more certainly than this town ? irrelevant- 
what am i waiting for ? 
who 's to make the change but me ? 
why 's that dream so necessary ? walking out of whatever house alone 
nothing but the clothes on my back , money or no 
down the road to the next place the highway leading to the 
from which i absolutely must come back 
what business have i to do that ? 
i know the world and i love it too much and it 
is not the one i 'd find outside this door . 
to see that buried dust of living fame , 
all suddenly i saw the fairy queen ; 
and groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce : 
come for duty 's sake ( as girls do ) we watch 
and stagger-blind friend , their daily split of gin . 
she pours big drinks . we think of what 
has crumpled , folded , slumped her flesh in 
herself . she hums , she plays with used bright 
ghosts , makes real dolls , and drinking sings come here 
shows how hot the oven is . 
( also she is alive with hate . 
also she is afraid of hell . also , we wish 
run from her smell , her teeth in the dish . ) 
we manage to mean well . we endure , and more . 
we learn time 's pleasure , catch our future and its cure .

a flashlight rolls over the walls of a cave , 
low on my still-flat belly . 
easy for her to say-she sees this all day . 
but it took us years to get to this point . 
years in the dark . months of nothing and never . 
which i ca n't stop reaching toward , 
pretending to point to features but really 
just longing to touch the image , 
as if it were somehow more there than in me , 
from the hand of an ancestor- 
the first art we know . 
walking past the open window , she is surprised 
by the song of the white-throated sparrow 
and stops to listen . she has been thinking of 
the dead ones she loves -- her father who lived 
over a century , and her oldest son , suddenly gone 
at forty-seven -- and she ca n't help thinking 
she has called them back , that they are calling her 
in the voices of these birds passing through ohio 
on their spring migration . . . because , after years 
has become something like the family bird . 
her father used to stop whatever he was doing 
and point out its clear , whistling song . she hears it 
has already thought it , and now she is weeping . 
but then she hears another , so clear , it 's as if 
the bird were in the room with her , or in her head , 
telling her that everything will be all right . 
she can not see them from her second-story window -- 
they are hidden in the new leaves of the old maple , 
or behind the white blossoms of the dogwood -- 
but she stands and listens , knowing they will stay 
for only a few days before moving on . 
his body ahead 
of him on the bed 
he faces his feet 
sees himself dead , 
a corpse complete 
with legs and chest 
and belly between 
swelling the scene 
of the crime you left , 
taking your time , 
angel of death 
thumbs , a man stumbling over his own muscles , unable to 
hold some part of himself and rock it , gently . she gave 
up , seeing him come in the door , wanting to show him her 
flat belly just an hour before , looking at her own corpse 
in the mirror . she lay there reduced , neither virgin nor mother . 
it had been decided . the winter was too cold in the garage . 
they would live with her mother . the old bedroom was 
already prepared , cleaned , the door opened . the solitary 
twin bed remained ; he would sleep on the porch . 
she looked at him and tried to feel her way into the body 
of a woman , a thing which has to be taken care of , held 
safely in his arms . 
she lay there , trying to hold on to what she had , knowing 
she had to let it go . 
the entrance at the back of the complex 
tilted into a ditch and a washing machine 
from the end , you turned left and left again , 
then cut a trail to find the cul-de-sac 
of bright brick houses . we 'd walk as far 
as we dared before a man pushing a mower 
that was a question we could never answer . 
i loved the name of the place , white hall , 
imagined that each interior was a stretch 
photos of the family . our own halls 
one sunny afternoon while watching baseball ; 
waiting for someone to say , `` smile . '' boys 
who , on those latch-key days , held themselves 
was there to show them what to do .

this is the man 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
this is the time 
of the tragic man 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
telling the time 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
this is a sailor 
wearing the watch 
that tells the time 
of the honored man 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
reached by the sailor 
wearing the watch 
that tells the time 
of the old , brave man 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
these are the years and the walls of the ward , 
the winds and clouds of the sea of board 
sailed by the sailor 
wearing the watch 
that tells the time 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
this is a jew in a newspaper hat 
that dances weeping down the ward 
over the creaking sea of board 
beyond the sailor 
winding his watch 
that tells the time 
of the cruel man 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
this is a world of books gone flat . 
this is a jew in a newspaper hat 
that dances weeping down the ward 
over the creaking sea of board 
that winds his watch 
that tells the time 
of the busy man 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
to see if the world is there , is flat , 
that dances weeping down the ward 
by the silent sailor 
that hears his watch 
that ticks the time 
of the tedious man 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
these are the years and the walls and the door 
to feel if the world is there and flat . 
this is a jew in a newspaper hat 
into the parting seas of board 
past the staring sailor 
that shakes his watch 
that tells the time 
of the poet , the man 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
this is the soldier home from the war . 
these are the years and the walls and the door 
to see if the world is round or flat . 
this is a jew in a newspaper hat 
that dances carefully down the ward , 
walking the plank of a coffin board 
with the crazy sailor 
that shows his watch 
that tells the time 
of the wretched man 
that lies in the house of bedlam . 
when i was two feet tall 
and held the hand above , 
how could i know 
that finger-inch of love . 
you saved me , you should remember me . 
laughter , because the air is full of apple blossoms . 
when i woke up , i realized i was capable of the same feeling . 
i remember sounds like that from my childhood , 
laughter for no cause , simply because the world is beautiful , 
something like that . 
and by the lake 's edge , a young man throws his hat into the water ; 
perhaps his sweetheart has accepted him . 
sounds or gestures like 
a track laid down before the larger themes 
islands in the distance . my mother 
holding out a plate of little cakes- 
as far as i remember , changed 
in no detail , the moment 
vivid , intact , having never been 
hungry for life , utterly confident- 
by the tables , patches of new grass , the pale green 
surely spring has been returned to me , this time 
not as a lover but a messenger of death , yet 
it is still spring , it is still meant tenderly .

high note held without trembling without voice without sound 
aura of complete darkness keeper of the kept secrets 
of the destroyed stories the escaped dreams the sentences 
window onto the hidden place and the other time 
at the foot of the wall by the road patient without waiting 
in the full moonlight of autumn at the hour when i was born 
you no longer go out like a flame at the sight of me 
you are still warmer than the moonlight gleaming on you 
as you have always been now when your light paws are running 
on the breathless night on the bridge with one end i remember you 
when i have heard you the soles of my feet have made answer 
as long as it lasted until something that we were 
had ended when you are no longer anything 
let me catch sight of you again going over the wall 
and before the garden is extinct and the woods are figures 
places in the silence after the animals 
they build time-shares in her head . they carve 
names deep in wood , erect beams of metal to hold up 
sometimes i imagine such men in flip-flops 
with fat towels draped over confident shoulders . 
i imagine they all live in texas , and find 
lit with the fire of sighs , casts spells , burns sage , 
but then there comes that moment rare 
when , for no cause that i can find , 
the little voices of the air 
sound above all the sea and wind . 
the sea and wind do then obey 
and sighing , sighing double notes 
the little throats that sing and rise 
up into the light with lovely ease 
and a kind of magical , sweet surprise 
to hear and know themselves for these- 
for these little voices : the bee , the fly , 
the breeze on the grass-tops bending by , 
the shrill quick sound that the insect makes . 
how could you miss that 
his body has a dark spot 
like doing laundry all day long 
he is being nowhere 
cottage cheese runs out his mouth 
another one and another one 
that doll can crawl 
mother as if spread 
if i could break 
the hymen of his ear with 
i ca n't stand you 
i wo n't say a thing and i wo n't notice 
god you are 
the softest 
kind of jerk 
and yesterday is gone 
and i had nothing to do with it 
of late to fill with them , a settling 
claim they can smell them , can hear them shuffling 
in the trees , a wing hitting a branch a sound 
sharp , they say , as ice cracking . they can not 
with that resolve , and every dusk they return 
of plot . they could not 
wait to landscape the plot . they had plans 
for a bed of pansies because pansies 
hardly ever die 
in a cold snap , 
into the soil 
it was with his hand 
on the handle and hers adding force . 
they knew there were only 
nine types of people in the world 
and they knew which ones 
would close the deal . they knew 
about how i feel and you feel . 
when there was a question 
of who did the dishes 
and who did the cat box , 
it was settled in-house 
it seemed there were n't really that many 
after all . 
and the yelling . 
it will be windy for a while until it is n't . the waves will shoal . a red-legged 
disappearing into surf . and when the low tide comes lapping and clear , the curled 
of two loops , two loose ends , our bodies on either side of this shore where we 
hands who know to take or be taken , but take nothing with them : i will marry you . 
i will marry you . so we can owe what we own to every beautiful thing . 
as if it were a vital organ 
the gods grew from the side of my head . 
you ca n't cover it with a hat and i no longer 
can sleep on that side it 's so tender . 
i was n't quite faithful enough 
to carry this sort of weight up the mountain . 
when i took my vows at nineteen 
fear makes for good servants 
i was n't awake enough . 
water opens without end 
at the bow of the ship 
rising to descend 
away from it 
days become one 
i am who i was 
we 've packed our bags , we 're set to fly 
no one knows where , the maps wo n't do . 
it has the clarity of earth and sky 
we have set out to live and die 
nowhere to be or be returning to 
we 've set our sights on nothing left to lose 
and made of loss itself a lullaby . 
( instructions for the visit ) 
admire , when you come here , the glimmering hair 
of the girl ; praise her pale 
though that is somewhat out of fashion . 
do n't try to take her hand , but smile for 
say the old woman is looking strong 
perhaps , how she has dressed herself black 
like a priest , and wears that sufficient air 
that does become the righteous . 
as you approach , she will push back 
her chair , shove away her plate 
and wait , 
sitting squat and direct , before 
massive as some great 
safe ; will wait , 
by the table and her greasy plate , 
the bone half-chewed , her wine half-drained ; 
she will wait . and fix her steady 
eyes on you-the straight stare 
try once to meet her eyes . but fail . 
let your sight 
drift-yet never as if hunting for 
the keys ( you keep imagining ) hung 
by her belt . ( they are not there . ) 
watch , perhaps , that massive chest-the way 
it tries to lean 
forward , toward her , till it seems to rest 
its whole household 's weight 
all on her stiff back . 
it might be strapped there like the monstrous pack 
like mercury in a ball , 
she can support this without strain , 
like a potato , parched as dung ; 
ask no one why the chest 
no least suspicion 
could vanish at her 
will . try not to think 
specific gravity , 
less as the world 's 
hard core 
and the per- 
in her . 
finally , above all , 
you must not ever see , 
or let slip one hint you can see , 
on the other side , the girl 's 
the half-fed , worrying eyes , and how 
she backs out , bows , and tries to bow 
out of the scene , grows too ethereal 
to make a shape inside her dress 
and the dress itself is beginning already 
to sublime itself away like a vapor 
of the air and of the bright wallpaper . 
is adrift a moment in that ice stiff 
low lying in the bay 
and wooded- ' native now 
we have not escaped each other , 
painfully in the new depths 
of the subway , and painfully 
we shift our eyes . the bare rails 
and black walls contain 
labor before her birth , her twisted 
quiet , her eyes still . slowly , 
deliberately she sees 
thru coins and coin machines , 
in the iron beneath us in the child 's deep 
your face turning from mine 
a wall cleared of nails 
for the ghosts to walk through 
between the wet trees and the sorry steeple , 
beauty 's a sinking light , ah , none too faithful ; 
some one love worth the ages and the nations ! 
nothing falls under thine eyes eternal . 
are still too young to understand 
that this is as good as it gets . 
their soul patches and tribal tattoos , 
pretending not to notice how beautiful they are , 
until they simply ca n't stand it 
and before you know it 
they 're lined up on lawn chairs , 
with their stretch marks and beer bellies , 
yesterday i was at the wailing wall 
pretending to be a man , pretending to be a jew 
it was research for my job 
still i tried to feel god , touched the wall 
said a prayer for my sick mother 
the women go to one side 
the men to the other 
around the corner is the empty co-ed wall 
has been conquered forty-four times 
on the other side of the fence 
one part of my body a hundred years old , one not even there anymore , 
for whom everything always was going too slowly , too slowly . 
you suck at me , pull at me , barbed wire knots of memory tear me , 
trying to heave itself back to its other way with you . 
but was there ever really any other way with you ? when i ran 
as though for my life , was n't i fleeing from you , or for you ? 
are n't i still ? when i snatch at one of your moments , and clutch it , 
a pebble , a planet , is n't it wearing away in my hand as though i , 
wait , though , wait : i should tell you too how happy i am , 
please know i love especially you , how every morning you turn over 
to do dusk , when all she hears from her speech-creatures is `` wait ! `` ? 
i 'm waiting for a poem , 
something rough , not elaborate or out of control , 
released from darkness . 
words that come naturally , without aiming at anything , 
a bullet without a target , 
warning shots to the sky 
in newly occupied lands . 
a poem that will well up in my chest 
and until it arrives 
i will listen to my children fighting in the next room 
and cast my gaze down at the table 
at an empty glass of milk 
with a trace of white along its rim 
my throat wrapped in silver 
waiting for late guests to arrive . . . . 
the barbarians are due here today . 
because the barbarians are coming today . 
why did our emperor get up so early , 
in state , wearing the crown ? 
because the barbarians are coming today 
and the emperor 's waiting to receive their leader . 
beautifully worked in silver and gold ? 
because the barbarians are coming today 
and things like that dazzle the barbarians . 
because the barbarians are coming today 
( how serious people 's faces have become . ) 
everyone going home lost in thought ? 
because night has fallen and the barbarians have n't come . 
and some of our men just in from the border say 
there are no barbarians any longer . 
now what 's going to happen to us without barbarians ? 
those people were a kind of solution . 
all my stories are about being left , 
all yours about leaving . so we should have known . 
should have known to leave well enough alone ; 
we knew , and we did n't . you said let 's put 
our cards on the table , your card 
was your body , the table my bed , where we did n't 
get till 4 am , so tired from wanting 
what we should n't that when we finally found our heads , 
we 'd lost our minds.love , i wanted to call you 
so fast . but so slow you could taste each 
letter licked into your particular and rose-like ear . 
l , love , for let 's wait.o , for oh no , let 's not.v 
for the precious v between your deep breasts 
( and the virtue of your fingers 
okay , e for enough . 
dawn broke , or shattered . once we 've made 
but not so wrong to try . 
that means taking a lot of walks , 
which neither of us is good at , 
for different reasons , and nights up till 2 
arguing whose reasons are better . 
years my marriage . 5 years you my friend . 
in mist , by mistake ( whose ? ) , means too much 
so we can keep the crazy beads clicking , 
clicking . it was n't a question 
it should be enough to say i left a man 
to leave it at that . oh , lazy world ) and when the woman 
lost her nerve , i left 
were useful , i used them , i confess . so i get 
what i deserve : a studio apartment he paid the rent on ; 
beneath , and two shiny quarters in my pocket 
to call one , then the other , or to call one 
twice . once , twice , i threatened to leave him- 
remember ? now that i 've done it , he says 
but two sheets of glass to shiver between . 
a number that you know wo n't be answered , 
but the message you leave leaves proof that you tried . 
coin , turn it over in my fingers , press 
many of my race have lived long without the touch of 
these fine things which separate us from beasts . things 
for a family far more ape than we will ever be , i rode 
the moonlight train to find my free . up here it is colder than i like , 
this coast for philadelphia where i hear we of color can breathe yet more free . 
we are waiting , grandmother and i , for the white bird . 
the black bird grows larger above our heads , 
its immense wings spreading as it dives down 
to pull her away piece by piece . 
grandmother is not ashamed ; 
she lies open before me , white as bone , 
i will stay until the bones are picked clean ; 
i will stay until the wide wings swallow the last of the light , 
until the white bird is free at last . 
as others or ourselves 
let 's say-furtive , then , 
or on the edge of thought , 
perhaps , or into some 
of water against its shore 
cuts and counter-cuts , 
remembered as landscape , 
of an abandoned past . 
against the sky or color 
freed from shadow or something 
of color deepening against shade , 
the sensible bluff that heaves 
again , always enclosed 
according to a friend she looked 
suitcase still in the trunk . 
she 'd carried him dead for days . 
out above the reeds a sphere of birds 
stretches and knots , rises as one 
brown then belly-white . oh the hunger 
when it came filled every chair . 
with the dazzling perfect meadows and limestone 
up in front by the door where the musicians sit , 
will i hear it ? maybe not . but i hear it now . 
of the melody , turning the bog-dark , root-tangled ground . 
cocks an ear as the tune lifts and the taut sail 
we sat here side by side , your body awake 
as the music found a path to my notebook . 
or walk out under the powerful stars to clear 
my head of thought and breathe their cooled-down fire . 
goodbye to the company and step into the night 
released from everything i 've done and known . 
i wo n't go willingly , it 's true , but i 'll be gone . 
turned to look at me , an arrow in its side . 
though i pity dreamers , taking a thread 
and weaving it upon the loom of self-the secret , 
gaudy , wonderful new cloth- , i will tell the end of the story . 
which i severed with the blade of the arrow , 
nearly stupid in my waiting for what would happen next , 
i woke , the sheets soaked , heart fluttering- : 
when death comes into the sleeping room as through a tiny hole , 
it is the morning . the country has slept the whole winter . 
window seats were covered with fur skins , the yard was full 
now we wake , and rise from bed , and eat breakfast ! 
shouts rise from the harbor of the blood , 
now we sing , and do tiny dances on the kitchen floor . 
our whole body is like a harbor at dawn ; 
we know that our master has left us for the day . 
i wake to sleep , and take my waking slow . 
i feel my fate in what i can not fear . 
i learn by going where i have to go . 
we think by feeling . what is there to know ? 
i hear my being dance from ear to ear . 
i wake to sleep , and take my waking slow . 
of those so close beside me , which are you ? 
god bless the ground ! i shall walk softly there , 
and learn by going where i have to go . 
light takes the tree ; but who can tell us how ? 
the lowly worm climbs up a winding stair ; 
i wake to sleep , and take my waking slow . 
great nature has another thing to do 
to you and me ; so take the lively air , 
and , lovely , learn by going where to go . 
this shaking keeps me steady . i should know . 
what falls away is always . and is near . 
i wake to sleep , and take my waking slow . 
i learn by going where i have to go . 
translated from the french 
not too close , wait . see the green blurs 
stitching the leaves ? 
i do n't imagine 
always nervous 
in a bell of petals ? 
do n't look so stunned , lay your pack 
in the needles and catch a breath . i know , 
you thought you knew me , 
and now to hear me talk this way ... 
i 'm glad i 've stopped pretending 
to love people 
and the cities where people ca n't love themselves . 
the shadows to eventually peel back to the trees . 
small wonder the angels are said to despise us . 
still , without them 
in the air ? and how easily 
to walk abroad is , not with eyes , 
but thoughts , the fields to see and prize ; 
else may the silent feet , 
like logs of wood , 
move up and down , and see no good 
nor joy nor glory meet . 
but can not see , though very strange 
the glory that is by ; 
move in the bright and glorious day , 
yet not behold the sky . 
and are not men than they more blind , 
who having eyes yet never find 
the bliss in which they move ; 
like statues dead 
they up and down are carried 
yet never see nor love . 
to walk is by a thought to go ; 
to move in spirit to and fro ; 
to mind the good we see ; 
to taste the sweet ; 
how choice and rich they be . 
to note the beauty of the day , 
admire each pretty flow'r 
with its sweet smell ; 
to praise their maker , and to tell 
the marks of his great pow'r . 
to fly abroad like active bees , 
among the hedges and the trees , 
on ev'ry blade , 
our minds , as they their thighs . 
observe those rich and glorious things , 
the rivers , meadows , woods , and springs , 
to note from far 
for us his race to run . 
who , tumbling in green grass and leaves , 
may rich as kings be thought , 
but there 's a sight 
which perfect manhood may delight , 
to which we shall be brought . 
while in those pleasant paths we talk , 
't is that tow'rds which at last we walk ; 
for we may by degrees 
wisely proceed 
pleasures of love and praise to heed , 
we will focus our attention on this gesture of walking . 
we will act in the manner of moving our legs forward . 
we will press our heels to the grass while we are in the process of movement and we will extend our toes forward . 
we will bend our knees as the soles of our feet press against the grass . 
as our knees bend we will lift our opposite foot at the heel and we will push our bent leg forward across space . 
at which point the heel of our opposite foot will lift and it will shift our point of balance . 
we will lift that heel and bend our legs . 
as we lift our opposite leg at a ninety-degree angle so that the top surfaces of our thighs are parallel to both the sky and the ground , we will shift our point of balance from the vertical and closer to a horizontal . 
we will shift our point of balance forward until our feet become pressed to the ground . 
at which point we will lift the heel of our opposite leg and draw our knee upward . 
we will focus our attention on neither where we are walking from , or to , at this time , but on the act of walking . 
there are many features to this . 
we will focus our attention on this manner of walking . 
especially on this day with clouds . 
whether we are walking in unison , it does not matter . 
and we will focus our attention on neither how long we have been walking nor how long it will continue , but on continuing this gesture in the manner of walking . 
we will focus on the way in which we are walking steadily forward . 
we will focus on this position while we are walking . 
whether we are walking in unison , it does not matter . 
in the manner of walking across a field now , we are walking in a direction forward while turning our heads at times toward each other . 
we will focus on this walking gesture and the expanse that surrounds our movement . 
we will focus on relation within this gesture of walking across a field . 
we will focus on this movement forward as we are walking across a field in relation . 
whether we are walking in unison , it does not matter . 
with relation to fields , it is the movement that is most important . 
rain so dark i 
ca n't get through- 
train going by 
in a hurry . the voice 
said walk or die , i 
walked , -the train 
and the voice all 
my bones and my heart 
of chalk , not even 
a splintered notion : 
days of thought , nights 
of worry , -lonesome 
train in a hurry . 
walking down park 
or columbus do you ever stop 
to think what it looked like 
before it was an avenue 
did you ever stop to think 
what you walked 
before you rode 
exchange ( we ca n't be on 
the stock exchange 
we are the stock 
did you ever maybe wonder 
what grass was like before 
they rolled it 
into a ball and called 
it central park 
the corners and side-walks 
ever want to know what would happen 
by a love thought 
from a loved one 
who loves you 
ever look south 
on a clear day and not see 
time 's squares but see 
touching hands 
after the lions 
ever hear the antelope bark 
from the third floor apartment 
ever , did you ever , sit down 
and wonder about what freedom 's freedom 
would bring 
it 's so easy to be free 
you start by loving yourself 
then those who look like you 
all else will come 
ever wonder why 
so much asphalt was laid 
in so little space 
probably so we would forget 
the earth 
ever think what harlem would be 
like if our herbs and roots and elephant ears 
grew sending 
and me and you just sitting in the sun trying 
ever think its possible 
for us to be 
long ago we quit lifting our heels 
like the others-horse , dog , and tiger- 
though we thrill to their speed 
as they flee . even the mouse 
there is little spring to our walk , 
bound stiff in the skins of the conquered . 
but sometimes , in the early hours , 
we can feel what it must have been like 
to be one of them , up on our toes , 
stealing past doors where others are sleeping , 
and suddenly able to see in the dark . 
walking person who has sky flowing-by one who beside is as if 
being backward by walking in life of people ? but of one being 'defense- 
'i was by a bigger bird - inside ' - walking 
walking by ( someone with the sky flowing ) disturbed by being- 
by it- 
( compared by being-to past event : man seeing red tail hawk sit- 
by someone ) -beside is 'embarrassing as being action ' in one- 
( from ) ( its ) ( in the ) present . 
in movies when the hero is about to die , 
hoping the words will come up again 
immortal , or the grasses will reach out for him 
as now they do for us . 
someone has planted a row of little trees 
to stop the wind . instead they 've learned 
in one direction only ; they know 
the sea will shatter them . 
is n't it always like this ? 
taking off its dress , the ice plants 
so we can see that their deaths 
of splendid rust and yellow are not ours , 
we are allowed again the glare 
the grasses brushing the legs , though 
just to have felt it once would have been enough . 
and sets her lipstick upright on the sink . 
the door ajar , i glimpse the yellow slip , 
and scarves , and i walk her to the bus stop 
where she 'll leave me for my own walk to school , 
romance already open on her lap , 
still startling my cheek with lipstick trace . 
anyone with quiet pace who 
walks a gray road in the west 
in deep flint another time is 
caught by flint and held forever , 
the quiet pace of god stopped still . 
anyone who listens walks on 
time that dogs him single file , 
to mountains that are far from people , 
the face of the land gone gray like flint . 
quiet-paced the land lies gaunt , 
the railroad dies by a yellow depot , 
town falls away toward a muddy creek . 
badger-gray the sod goes under 
a river of wind , a hawk on a stick . 
walking home i feel a presence following 
and realize he is always there 
that native man with coal-black-hair who is 
my grandfather . in my first memories 
he is present , mostly wordless , 
my mother shows him the cleft in my chin 
identical to his . i am swaddled 
and blinking in the kitchen light . so 
the bone-house where my heart beats . 
what my mother said of her : 
she kept a pot of stew on the stove 
all day for anyone to eat . 
she never went to church but said 
you could be a good person anyway . 
her back porch a regular stop-over . 
every person has rights no matter 
this son of hers , my grandfather , 
still walks the streets with me . 
some twist of blood and heat still spark 
across the time bridge . here , listen : 
air draws through these lungs made from his . 
his blood still pulses through this hand . 
in the dark evening , my father and i 
walk down the road to the old house 
where my grandmother lived , 
and we see through the door an old woman 's feet 
still in her thick stockings , 
the feet with legs and stockings 
looking just like grandma 's 
after bearing nine children who lived , 
standing , working all day , 
for all of us each hot morning , 
did laundry , then lunch , 
supper , and worked with the animals 
or cleaning fish 
the rest of the day . 
i want to go open that door as i did 
so many times in the past , remembering 
not to slam the screen , as everyone would yell 
although i am now also older and finite , 
the seams of myself coming apart . 
how i wish i could go to that woman 
with her legs up and rub her feet , 
years have passed through the doors 
of that house , of memory , doors of the past 
and my father 's eyes 
are sad , looking in , 
his own memories , not mine , 
thinking maybe of his mother 
the bracelet he gave me with his r.a. number . 
as my grandfather 's , 
as those before them , 
i think of what this poem is about , 
only partly about memory , 
our many losses . 
and walking with my father 
i walk with my grandparents , 
among the first to be numbered : 
someone has opened a giant map 
and with the tips of our fingers , 
each of us suddenly blind , 
we track the black cold of this monument 
for names we know 
like finding a route home . 
lost here 
this damp spring morning , 
the cherries exploding like the fourth of july , 
sold those years , 
so many strange sounding places . 
small print in the polished stone , 
might have done , late at night 
hearing again the morning paper 
thump against the front door , 
that boy on his bike in the dark 
grown and gone-what was his name , 
that kid from down the block ? - 
i try and try not to think about the wall . 
no one knows who had it built , or when ; 
enough to have been there more than a thousand . 
or else they 're us , going beyond its limits 
and some blocks are dragged off to build new houses . 
winding through dark-blue mountains farther north . . . 
made at an age when we assume our name 
when i move the leaves and read it there again . 
my parents argued over wallpaper . would stripes 
make the room look larger ? he 
the flaws out with her brush . once it was properly 
hung , doubt would set in . would the floral 
have been a better choice ? then it would grow 
until she was certain : it had to go . divorce 
terrified me as a child . i did n't know 
the stripes came down . up went 
of marriage : bad choices , arguments 
but everything done together and done well .

of nuclear buttons and knew 
it was a green one they told him to push , 
of arrows , then turned and ran . 
sleeping against a wall of flowers , 
the beautiful smell giving him the answer 
he had been looking for . 
onto the studio floor . 
in a hole in the wall , but when a fellow nun 
it was gone . 
and bowed his head to pray before the wall 
of dead monks killed by the chinese . 
was the wall of family portraits , the photographs 
of her father and brothers so radiant in the river fog . 
of the jail with his bare hands and walked away . 
in her los angeles hotel , her face facing the wall . 
when he was shot under the trees . 
in a wall of bamboo , staying inside the tube 
for ten years , never saying a word , his feet 
becoming the roots of bamboo within 
the first few months of his silence . 
trying to get them right .

`` the sun was shining on the sea , 
shining with all his might : 
he did his very best to make 
the billows smooth and bright - 
and this was odd , because it was 
the middle of the night . 
because she thought the sun 
had got no business to be there 
after the day was done - 
`` it 's very rude of him , '' she said , 
`` to come and spoil the fun . '' 
the sea was wet as wet could be , 
the sands were dry as dry . 
you could not see a cloud , because 
no cloud was in the sky : 
no birds were flying overhead - 
there were no birds to fly . 
the walrus and the carpenter 
were walking close at hand ; 
they wept like anything to see 
if this were only cleared away , ' 
they said , it would be grand ! ' 
swept it for half a year , 
do you suppose , ' the walrus said , 
that they could get it clear ? ' 
i doubt it , ' said the carpenter , 
and shed a bitter tear . 
o oysters , come and walk with us ! ' 
a pleasant walk , a pleasant talk , 
we can not do with more than four , 
to give a hand to each . ' 
but never a word he said : 
and shook his heavy head - 
meaning to say he did not choose 
to leave the oyster-bed . 
but four young oysters hurried up , 
all eager for the treat : 
their coats were brushed , their faces washed , 
their shoes were clean and neat - 
and this was odd , because , you know , 
they had n't any feet . 
four other oysters followed them , 
and yet another four ; 
and thick and fast they came at last , 
and more , and more , and more - 
the walrus and the carpenter 
walked on a mile or so , 
and then they rested on a rock 
and all the little oysters stood 
and waited in a row . 
the time has come , ' the walrus said , 
to talk of many things : 
of shoes - and ships - and sealing-wax - 
and why the sea is boiling hot - 
and whether pigs have wings . ' 
but wait a bit , ' the oysters cried , 
before we have our chat ; 
for some of us are out of breath , 
and all of us are fat ! ' 
no hurry ! ' said the carpenter . 
a loaf of bread , ' the walrus said , 
pepper and vinegar besides 
are very good indeed - 
now if you 're ready , oysters dear , 
we can begin to feed . ' 
but not on us ! ' the oysters cried , 
turning a little blue . 
after such kindness , that would be 
a dismal thing to do ! ' 
the night is fine , ' the walrus said . 
do you admire the view ? 
it was so kind of you to come ! 
and you are very nice ! ' 
the carpenter said nothing but 
cut us another slice : 
i wish you were not quite so deaf - 
i 've had to ask you twice ! ' 
it seems a shame , ' the walrus said , 
to play them such a trick , 
after we 've brought them out so far , 
and made them trot so quick ! ' 
the carpenter said nothing but 
the butter 's spread too thick ! ' 
i weep for you , ' the walrus said : 
holding his pocket-handkerchief 
before his streaming eyes . 
o oysters , ' said the carpenter , 
you 've had a pleasant run ! 
but answer came there none - 
and this was scarcely odd , because 
they 'd eaten every one . ''

( yes , they can be both . do n't you think i know ? ) 
list : then . war . event . now . history . list . 
of the disappeared whose children live still . 
list : blessing . curse . wife . slave . savior . savage . 
he who brings food to the starving gets cooked . 
draw in , breathe out . 
the cup was small , 
the coffee harsh . i had 
to catch a train from marble arch . 
i had to find my friends . 
who cares what happened ? 
towards the river . an old lady 
maybe i could stop the picture . 
buildings of stirred beach glass . 
the world goes sad . like now ? 
and like a dying lady , lean and pale , 
out of her chamber , led by the insane 
she wants a house full of cups and the ghosts 
three cords of ash , an axe ; i want 
a clean gas flame . she wants a row of jars : 
steam rising from rice . she wants goats , 
chickens , children . feeding and weeping . i want 
tenderness . touch ancient as the river . 
i want a woman 's wit swift as a fox . 
she 's in her city , meeting 
of the twelve years of wanting , apart and together . 
we 've kissed all weekend ; we want 
to drive the hundred miles and try it again . 
but they cost hundreds of dollars . 
i was satisfied , so long as it was n't impossible . 
and my tea 
i need an intellectual 
and a poet 
to divide my life among them 
and i 'll announce , after a while 
i need a servant 
a lover to have me murdered 
beaten to death 
by sandals in the bath : 
i need a queen 
to betray me with the king 
the famous ones have passed hours in front of , 
said to have been carved from a lovely river 
the sun time of the year died out and never might return . 
i wanted to be a mountain . 
blood is everywhere as always . 
we contain no blood with which to soften and warm the sad word . 
cold wind placed and places the house in its mouth . 
we met the end numb and almost still . 
number meant less motion meant even number meant totally still . 
the buildings stand still . 
the buildings still stand . 
heaven to be , and god to come , again . 
drinks his dark rum all day , and is content . 
in sodden trenches i have heard men speak , 
though numb and wretched , wise and witty things ; 
yet now those men lay stubborn courage by , 
riding dull-eyed and silent in the train 
love the low-laughing girls , who now again 
( after the russian ) 
the piano has crawled into the quarry . hauled 
the piano is waiting for the axe . 
it lies on its belly like a lizard , 
droning , heaving , hardly fashioned 
blood red : his frozen fingers cleft , 
two on the right hand , five on the left , 
seven fingers pick out rhymes and rhythm , 
the frozen skin , steaming , peels off them , 
flicker and flash like the great northern lights . 
everything played before is a great lie . 
the reflections of flaming chandeliers- 
in warm concert halls-wild lies . 
but the steel of the piano howls in me , 
i lie in the quarry and i am deft 
as the lizard . i accept the gift . 
i 'll be a song for russia , i 'll be 
there 's the girl who does a milk-round in the rain , 
and the girl who calls for orders at your door . 
strong , sensible , and fit , 
they 're out to show their grit , 
they 're going to keep their end up 
there 's the motor girl who drives a heavy van , 
there 's the butcher girl who brings your joint of meat , 
beneath each uniform 
beats a heart that 's soft and warm , 
they 've no time for love and kisses 
for a saving grace , we did n't see our dead , 
who rarely bothered coming home to die 
but simply stayed away out there 
in the clean war , the war in the air . 
seldom the ghosts come back bearing their tales 
but stayed up there in the relative wind , 
shades fading in the mind , 
where never so many spoke for never so few : 
that was the good war , the war we won 
as if there was no death , for goodness 's sake . 
in the air , in the empty air . 
do not weep , maiden , for war is kind . 
because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky 
do not weep . 
war is kind . 
little souls who thirst for fight , 
these men were born to drill and die . 
great is the battle-god , great , and his kingdom- 
a field where a thousand corpses lie . 
do not weep , babe , for war is kind . 
because your father tumbled in the yellow trenches , 
do not weep . 
war is kind . 
eagle with crest of red and gold , 
these men were born to drill and die . 
point for them the virtue of slaughter , 
and a field where a thousand corpses lie . 
mother whose heart hung humble as a button 
on the bright splendid shroud of your son , 
do not weep . 
war is kind . 
in the old times of peace we went our ways , 
through proper days 
of little joys and tasks . lonely at times , 
when from the steeple sounded wedding chimes , 
telling to all the world some maid was wife- 
but taking patiently our part in life 
believing it our fate . 
our thoughts all chaste 
held yet a secret wish to love and mate 
ere youth and virtue should go quite to waste . 
and kept them at arm 's length . 
then the war came- 
the world was all aflame ! 
the men we had thought dull and void of power 
were heroes in an hour . 
he who had seemed a slave to petty greed 
and we were only women , forced by war 
to sacrifice the things worth living for . 
something within us broke , 
something within us woke , 
the wild cave-woman spoke . 
when we heard the sound of drumming , 
as our soldiers went to camp , 
heard them tramp , tramp , tramp ; 
as we watched to see them coming , 
and they looked at us and smiled 
( yes , looked back at us and smiled ) , 
then our hearts were so beguiled 
that , for many and many a day , 
we dreamed we heard them say , 
'oh , follow , follow , follow ! ' 
and the distant , rolling drum 
called us 'come , come , come ! ' 
till our virtue seemed a thing to give away . 
war had swept ten thousand years away from earth . 
we could hear them calling to us , 'come to-night ; 
for to-morrow , at the dawn , 
we move on ! ' 
and the drum 
whistled , 'life , life , life ! ' 
so they moved on and fought and bled and died ; 
of our red blood , we gave the world new lives . 
because we were not wives 
to break god 's laws only by killing men 
to save one 's country from destruction ? 
to plant young trees and fill felled forests in . 
bible in hand , 
on holy thoughts intent 
had you the open visions you could see 
who never knew a cradle or a tomb , 
ours to the four winds of the earth are blown . 
working with one eye closed or heads buried 
to history and the world 's memory of death . 
but show us too the makeshift hospital , 
among the ruins . also enough of sky 
to suggest the infinity of angles , 
war the war , the sorry edge 
of us , because we stacked nice 
clean plates for days , we were 
sure things when love broke 
five fish slapping on the steps 
of the old town hall , it was winter , 
and writing it all down , the law 
of legs , the law of how we sleep , 
the law of shoulders killing me , 
and now we fold clothes without 
thinking my clothes your clothes 
and war the war o happy war 
what love we are so badly bitten 
in this long-term necessary chapel 
no one else beside us 
but ourselves beside ourselves . 
i do not understand why men make war . 
of what flesh can become ? 
is it because the military plan is the final map 
hour ? 
i do not understand why men make war . 
among the splintered bones of children , women , men and cattle 
forever ? 
is it because war is the secret room of all things to be kept 
the hot key that men and only men must possess for an eternal 
evening to visit and contemplate , to snap open a favorite window 
the telephone never rings . still 
you pick it up , smile into the static , 
the breath of those you 've loved ; long dead . 
the leaf you pick from the fall 
rises and dips away with every ridge . 
fingers stiff from time , you trace . 
you have forgotten none of the long-ago joy 
of an ice-cream truck and its summer song . 
between tea , a cup , and the sound 
of you pouring ; 
between the time you woke that morning 
and the time when the letter came , 
able only to tease with a weak sting . 
riding the elevator all day , 
floor after floor after floor , 
from the hard stone of death , you smile . 
and i found myself in a quiet corner staring 
i could still smell the smoldering high-tech plastic 
as it burned the air . in the whiteness of her teeth , 
where plain form is a place of no desire 
like the empty mirror of the hudson at dawn . 
led back and back behind her teeth longing- 
of a president 's limp dick and the crisp sheets 
of melting in the morning light . 
warm summer sun , 
shine kindly here , 
warm southern wind , 
blow softly here . 
green sod above , 
lie light , lie light . 
good night , dear heart , 
good night , good night . 
next to my own skin , her pearls . my mistress 
bids me wear them , warm them , until evening 
when i 'll brush her hair . at six , i place them 
round her cool , white throat . all day i think of her , 
whilst i work willingly , my slow heat entering 
each pearl . slack on my neck , her rope . 
she 's beautiful . i dream about her 
in my attic bed ; picture her dancing 
with tall men , puzzled by my faint , persistent scent 
beneath her french perfume , her milky stones . 
i dust her shoulders with a rabbit 's foot , 
my red lips part as though i want to speak . 
full moon . her carriage brings her home . i see 
taking off her jewels , her slim hand reaching 
for the case , slipping naked into bed , the way 
she always does ... . and i lie here awake , 
knowing the pearls are cooling even now 
in the room where my mistress sleeps . all night 
i feel their absence and i burn . 
a can of self-defense pepper spray says it may 
as clear milk rubs shoulders with a box 
of rat poison which has been found 
a sign that says the very fact of saying , 
not intended for highway use ? or that 
to give the reader the illusion of the ordinary . 
can not protect any part of the body they do not cover . 
i load boxes of books onto the counter . flip 
than whiteness which lasts only a day . 
a.a.ers talk about the blinding glare of the obvious : 
objects in the mirror are actually behind you . 
warning : knives are sharp . thank you ! 
what would i have done without : remove infant 
while sleeping , eating pet rocks may lead to broken teeth , 
with orders of this field , no landing here 
trust in the instruments which fall their round , 
tonight the only ceiling is the ground ; 
zero , from nothing into nothing made , 
notice the fog that makes me all but blind ; 
here in the tower my skeleton will do 
to signal you . i am for all your kind 
suggest you take along the death's-head flag 
and hope that waving it will set you free . 
judgment , like flights , may be a game of tag 
christ understands . he also got his letter . 
i have you , heroes , holding each your course : 
you shot them up a little , and you grope 
tonight with neither memory nor remorse ; 
until you make an error in this fog . 
for love-i would 
split open your head and put 
a candle in 
behind the eyes . 
love is dead in us 
if we forget 
and quick surprise . 
was he married , did he try 
to support as he grew less fond of them 
wife and family ? 
no , 
he never suffered such a blow . 
his bent strong and his mind full . 
did he love people very much 
yet find them die one day ? 
he did not love in the human way . 
did he ask how long it would go on , 
wonder if death could be counted on for an end ? 
he did not feel like this , 
he had a future of bliss . 
did he never feel strong 
pain for being wrong ? 
he was not wrong , he was right , 
he suffered from others ' , not his own , spite . 
but there is no suffering like having made a mistake 
his thoughts were different . 
did he lack friends ? worse , 
think it was for his fault , not theirs ? 
he did not lack friends , 
did he feel over-handicapped sometimes , yet must draw even ? 
how could he feel like this ? he was the king of heaven . 
... find a sudden brightness one day in everything 
because a mood had been conquered , or a sin ? 
i tell you , he did not sin . 
only human beings feel this , 
it is because they are so mixed . 
a god can not carry it , he is not able . 
a god is man 's doll , you ass , 
he makes him up like this on purpose . 
he might have made him up worse . 
he often has , in the past . 
to choose a god of love , as he did and does , 
is a little move then ? 
yes , it is . 
a larger one will be when men 
it will be a larger one . 
wash of cold river 
chill , snow-ribbed sand , 
drift of rare flowers , 
clear , with delicate shell- 
frozen lily-leaf , 
colder than a rose ; 
that keeps the breath 
of the north-wind- 
these and none other ; 
intimate thoughts and kind 
reach out to share 
the treasure of my mind , 
intimate hands and dear 
drawn garden-ward and sea-ward 
all the sheer rapture 
that i would take 
to mould a clear 
rare , of pure texture , 
beautiful space and line , 
marble to grace 
too close to me , he told them to back up 
seven caught me under the bed crying and said : 
save those tears . you 'll need them later . 
the man who told me he smoked crack 
because he liked it , the man sitting on his couch 
now watching the history channel , scratching 
across the room trying to conjure each version 
he 's shown of himself , trying to lie 
in water warm enough 
to soak away the switch he hit me with . 
to help me summon love for the man 
the man who once told me : wish 
in one hand , then shit in the other , 
four doors with no power but the engine , 
the car i drive on dates , park on dark lanes 
to ask for a kiss , now my hand goes along 
in the bucket , my father standing at the gate , 
poor and proud , tall and stout , a wise man , 
a man troubled by a son gone missing 
in the head , drag racing his only car 
the men who pack guns and knives , a son 
dirty cars washed on saturday morning . 
he tells me not to miss a spot , to open 
the hood when i 'm done so he can check 
the oil , the vital thing like blood , blood 
of a son walking prodigal paths leading 
to gutters . years later i tell him the stories 
of what his brother-in-law did to me , and 
wraps it in a white handkerchief for church , 
walks up the stairs with the aluminum 
and in these brittle years of his old age we 
grow deeper , talk way after midnight , 
in the dark , in the bitter wind 
listen to a dream 
shoulder to shoulder , on the rim of a hill 
bend as one , and grasp one thing together 
ask them , in the dream world , why 
do they cry ? they will show you in reply 
sweep you in , teach you how 
once a year , in the dark of the year we wash 
the whole world in a day-for one day , we cry 
until they 're home , until they all are home 
from one dawn to the next mourning 
for the broken wailing for regrets 
love lost , wrong words , wrong actions 
and heart , parent and child 
lover and beloved friend , nation and nation 
creature , and creature of another kind 
for what we choose and what we neglect to choose 
for what we wish we 'd known 
one whisper falling short of heard 
until they 're home , until they are all home 
the confusion the broken road 
these things we gather in this blanket 
bone and sand and sage 
we wash the world , between us 
hold this blanket , fill it with our tears 
and when we have cried 
from one dawn to the next 
then we will rise , and we will dance 
until they 're home , until they all are home 
lay your hands upon the truth of beauty 's loss 
heavy , soft as moss , this blanket 
full of tears and dust and dying 
becomes ocean cradle , healing , dark 
the promise , washed clean by our sorrow 
not so much redemption 
as the law of moon and season 
calls for justice 
exit their echoing halls , fall in 
carry it cry it clean 
until they 're home , until they are all home 
until light through their bodies 
translates to rainbows hung over the land 
until light through their bodies 
translates to rainbows strung over this land 
until light through our bodies 
translates to rainbows shining over our land 
until we 're home , until we all are home 
rich , honored by my fellow citizens , 
the father of many children , born of a noble mother , 
all raised there 
in the great mansion-house , at the edge of town . 
note the cedar tree on the lawn ! 
the while my life went on , getting more riches and honors- 
resting under my cedar tree at evening . 
the years went on . 
i sent the girls to europe ; 
i gave the boys money to start in business . 
they were strong children , promising as apples 
before the bitten places show . 
but john fled the country in disgrace . 
i sat under my cedar tree . 
susan was divorced- 
i sat under my cedar tree . 
i sat under my cedar tree . 
i sat under my cedar tree . 
my mate , the mother of them , was taken- 
i sat under my cedar tree 
possessed of this city , we are born 
eyes that looked upon 
the calm of marble , 
in long distances , 
meaningless dimensions , 
as pain sprouts at the edge of joy , 
as grief grows large with our years . 
skeleton steel may shadow the path , 
but we shall walk again 
side by side with others on the street , 
each certain of his way home . 
where are you wandering to , little fools 
come , big sister will teach you how to write verse 
it was the fruit i wanted , not the nest . 
against the sun . i took the nest 
and with it came the heart , and in my hand 
the kingdom and the queen , frail surfaces , 
rested for a moment . then the drones 
awoke and did their painful business . 
i let the city drop upon the stones . 
it bled the insect gold , 
the secret heart was broken suddenly . 
i , to whom the knowledge had been given , 
who was not after knowledge but a fruit , 
remember how a knot of pains 
i swaddled my fat hand in cotton . 
after a week pain gave it back to me 
a second fruit is growing on the tree . 
identical-the droning in the leaves . 
everything that was young went quickly , 
the way his eyes met mine as soon as we 
feeling as if all the things that were falling 
would fall and make their thunder , leave 
us with the challenge of being happy , 
all the things that felt given when gifts 
were not just surprises , but what we 
knew , what we hoped to take with us 
not deceived the way we were when 
the end came to what we knew of china , 
landing me here . i am a wish in the skies 
spun out from celestial space to be poor , 
to be covered with black skin , a felt 
quilt of a map with only one way to china - 
at killing time on black farms in alabama - 
the noise of death , the shrill needle 
that turns clouds over to rip the air 
above the cities where people are young 
and all that is given is never taken away . 
ruth visits her mother 's grave in the california hills . 
she knows her mother is n't there but the rectangle of grass 
marks off the place where the memories are kept , 
better bird-watcher than cook ; 
in the summer hills , where the tall tough grass 
and the endless wind 
reminds you of indifference , 
because as soon as she is gone she knows 
the deer come out of the woods to eat them . 
what was made for the eye 
goes into the mouth , 
thinks ruth to herself as she drives away , 
and in bed when she tries to remember her mother , 
she drifts instead to the roses , 
and when she thinks about the roses she 
sees instead the deer chewing them- 
pale petals of the roses in the dark 
warm bellies of the sleeping deer- 
that 's what going to sleep is like . 
a small wheel 
shivering like 
a pinned butterfly . 
hands thrown up 
in all directions : 
one arrives at 
in a nightmare . 
higher than that 
of the open watch . 
other wheels 
that could fit 
that must be splinters 
of arctic starlight . 
tiny golden mills 
grinding invisible 
coffee beans . 
when the coffee 's boiling 
so it does n't burn us , 
we raise it 
to the lips 
of the nearest 
ear . 
two women on the lone wet strand 
( the wind 's out with a will to roam ) 
( and a ship is long due home . ) 
the sea sprays in the women 's eyes- 
( for the wind 's out with a will to roam . ) 
`` o daughter , thine eyes be better than mine , '' 
( the waves ascend high as yonder dome ) 
`` north or south is there never a sign ? '' 
( and a ship is long due home . ) 
they watched there all the long night through- 
( the wind 's out with a will to roam ) 
wind and rain and sorrow for two- 
( and heaven on the long reach home . ) 
ten thousand women 
and i 
the only one 
in boots 
life 's dance : 
they meet 
he holds her leg 
and reason calmly in our tongue 
for hiding from the truth . 
you ca n't outrun stupid . 
we the people hold some truths 
to be self-evident : our magnificent brain 
in a body that ca n't flee , ca n't smell fear , 
ca n't hear death , ca n't see straight . 
as intricate as any telescope array , 
and give us time to bolt . 
until we look up in august 
to find comet dust flaring in the night . 
mocking gravity on our speck of now , 
but soon our familiar star will claw toward us 
in seven-league boots from the east , 
and would pour over us 
thirty seconds of yellow lichen . 
thirty seconds of coil and surge , 
fern and froth , thirty seconds 
of salt , rock , fog , spray . 
moving slowly to the left- 
a door in a rock through which you could see 
another rock , 
of tidal drag , fingering 
the smaller stones 
down the black beach-what color 
their salmon-colored hands . 
i stood and i shot them . 
i stood and i watched them 
right after i shot them : thirty seconds of smashed sea 
while the real sea 
they were the most boring movies ever made . 
i wanted 
to mount them together and press play . 
riding the swells , curved in a row 
just under the water- 
the sea , 
over and over . 
before it 's over . 
we start stopping when she 's afraid 
something bad will happen . do n't worry , 
i say , all will be well . 
how could she know ? she 's never 
read it , never heard of elizabeth 
she needs to know how things will end . 
i know elizabeth will be fine . as i knew , 
last week , my sister weeping , that elinor- 
on the couch with the last hours . 
how much my sister will have to endure , 
alone , with this new drama . 
later her message . the last one 
in which she will sound like herself . 
hear the word of the lord , 
for i am a jealous god betrayed . 
has fallen to other affections . 
her loom and the cloth of her weaving ; 
yea , as she sleeps in her bed , 
i will cause to burn in the night 
her barns filled with swallows , 
the velvet of her touch , once royal , 
for i am a god betrayed ; my love 
has reached into my weakness 
and turned my heart like a fist . 
therefore , i will strip her naked 
and drive her into the field . 
in her body of filth and feathers , 
her blood of beasts and men , she is 
for my cosmos is contracted . 
my first world slips from my hands . 
that i loved her more than love , 
and she gave not love in return . 
along the walls and windows . 
it glances from my mirrors 
and breaks the east wind 's bones . 
i was a god of such strength 
they could not guess my name . 
and this woman of human warmth 
now i dwell with the mole , blindly , 
i grieve what grinds in me , heavily . 
i am but a half note , half sung . 
not that i understand things . 
where moon throws 
a river of light , how angels would walk the ocean 
if they wanted to walk . 
they do n't . they hover . a lot of space 
between them and what 
shines like waves . which ca n't 
be a choice , for angels or 
which is n't much , but they are 
big animals , four feet across counting 
the wind involved 
really of wings . i guess 
a stirring , something in the black expanse 
he hoped to razor into 
not a razor at all . 
still , to cut them their flight on metal 
takes a while . his hands stiff , 
endlessly later rest of us 
do what we do and do until 
it 's not what we do . 
nevertheless , angels . why did they 
keep coming , one by one radiant 
dark of a mind paused to 
this most desolate given : water at night . 
that it floods a future not 
even in the picture . 
spout of a leaf , 
listen out for the screams 
of your relentless audience : 
the applause of a waterfall 
in the distance , 
a miami shopping mall . 
how careful you are 
with the rain-cradling 
curve of your back . 
near your forest , 
all are ready to swim 
and happy to drown 
in me : this lake of fire 
from my mouth , 
they come to peel the flames 
and drink their slick throats 
into the most silent 
of ashes . 
to the memory of a friend , 
finally , from your house , there is no view ; 
the bay 's blind mirror shattered over you 
the wind rolled up to shore . the senseless drowned 
have faces nobody would care to see , 
and you belonged to water , it to you , 
your house , the bay giving you reason to , 
where now , if seasons still are running straight , 
that watched them from your porch . i saw one once 
whose back was a history of how we live ; 
grown onto every inch of plate , except 
where the hinges let it move , were living things , 
blue bit of polished glass , glued there by time : 
with pride , it seemed , as if endurance only 
matters in the end . or so i thought . 
steer through planted poles that mark the way , 
and other lights , across the bay , faint stars 
lining the border of long island 's shore , 
come on at night , they still come on at night , 
though who can see them now i do not know . 
wild roses , at your back porch , break their blood , 
and bud to test surprises of sea air , 
and the birds fly over , gliding down to feed 
at the two feeding stations you set out with seed , 
or splash themselves in a big bowl of rain 
you used to fill with water . going across 
that night , too fast , too dark , no one will know , 
maybe you heard , the last you 'll ever hear , 
which shakes the blood and always brings to mind 
hunting in the weeds below your landing stairs , 
standing in a stillness that now is yours . 
my earliest wish was not to exist , 
to burst in the backyard 
without violence , 
no blood , no fleshy bits , 
mute button pressed 
where no one would see me . 
into the atmosphere . to hang 
rise until they freeze 
the water was rising , i got up on the bed 
but now go the bells , and we are ready 
perched like ghostly birds 
there 's rough life in the rust 
long-buried whore 's eggs , razor-clams with shells 
and a heron on the horizon many sewing-days ago 
jane , jane , ascend the stairs 
of the river 's mouth at the year 's turn 
of the animals that have nearly all forsaken us 
for new orleans and the people of the gulf coast 
water water water wind water 
across the land shape of a torn heart 
alabama wind calls alabama 
and the roofs blow across red clouds 
inside the divine spiral 
there is a voice 
inside the voice there is light 
water wind fire smoke the bodies float 
and rise 
kind flames bow down and move across 
water rises houses fall the child 
the elders the mothers underwater 
who will live who will rise 
the windows fill with the howling 
who who in the wet night jagged in the oil 
it is the shape of a lost hand a wing broken 
her last breath a rose in the razor rain 
in the negative shade someone is afloat 
a family dissolves the nation disappears 
neighborhoods fade across lost streets the police 
dressed in newspapers flutter toward nothingness moons 
who goes there 
under our floors filtered wooden stars 
towels and glass gasoline coffins 
algae of the nameless stroll in the dark ask 
the next question about kindness 
hear the song of splinters and blood tree sap 
holds the hand of his lover saying take care of the children 
let me go now let me stumble stumble nowhere drink this 
earth liquor going in petals 
again and again a new land edge emerges 
a new people emerges where race and class and death 
and life and water and tears and loss 
and life and death destruction and life and tears 
compassion and loss and a fire stolen bus 
you are alive still 
fixed a shape in the field 
and we stopped and saw 
in the oats-white dash 
on a page of green , 
flick of a blade 
cutting paint to canvas . 
it dipped its head 
bled onto the absence that 
head up again , its sugar legs 
here in a field was the imagined world 
until all at once it startled , 
and leapt away- 
a white tooth 
in the closing mouth of the woods . 
to image . 
in such a state , 
the wave has become a setting- 
a table across which cups 
are passed . 
the passage of cups does not limit 
and yet at no point does the wave 
the shades 
are drawn and we are 
advancing , the disc of its body 
it reveals itself in a cluster of pulses . 
it passes between bands of bright 
water , a kiss or a plow . 
they were sitting on the thin mattress 
he 'd once rolled & amp ; carried up the four floors 
to his room only to find it covered nearly all 
of the bare wood 
leaving just a small path alongside the wall 
& amp ; between them was the sack 
of oranges & amp ; pears she 'd brought its neck 
turned back to expose the colors of the fruit 
& amp ; as she opened a bottle of wine 
he reached over to a tall stack of books 
handed it across the bed to her she looked up 
& amp ; simply poured the two squat water glasses 
half-full with wine & amp ; then she 
took the book reading silently not aloud 
as he 'd assumed & amp ; suddenly he felt clearly 
she knew the way 
two people must come upon such an understanding 
together of course but separately 
i wanted to know what it was like before we 
had voices and before we had bare fingers and before we 
had minds to move us through our actions 
and tears to help us over our feelings , 
so i drove my daughter through the snow to meet her friend 
as an animal would , pressing my forehead against her , 
walking in circles , moaning , touching her cheek , 
and turned my head after them as an animal would , 
her smiling face and her small hand just visible 
as they made their turn into the empty highway . 
man , he said , sitting on the steps 
your car sure needs a wash and wax job 
i can do it for you for 5 bucks , 
i got the wax , i got the rags , i got everything 
i need . 
i gave him the 5 and went upstairs . 
when i came down 4 hours later 
he was sitting on the steps drunk 
and offered me a can of beer . 
he said he 'd get the car the next 
day . 
the next day he got drunk again and 
wine . his name was mike 
his wife worked as a nurse . 
the next day i came down and he was sitting 
on the steps and he said , 
you know , i been sitting here looking at your car , 
wondering just how i was gon na do it , 
i wan na do it real good . 
the next day mike said it looked like rain 
and it sure as hell would n't make any sense 
to wash and wax a car when it was gon na rain . 
the next day it looked like rain again . 
and the next . 
then i did n't see him anymore . 
a week later i saw his wife and she said , 
they took mike to the hospital , 
he 's all swelled-up , they say it 's from the 
drinking . 
listen , i told her , he said he was going to wax my 
car , i gave him 5 dollars to wax my 
car . 
he might die . . . 
i was sitting in their kitchen 
drinking with his wife 
when the phone rang . 
she handed the phone to me . 
it was mike . listen , he said , come down and 
get me , i ca n't stand this 
place . 
i drove on down there , walked into the 
hospital , walked up to his bed and 
said , let 's go mike . 
they would n't give him his clothes 
so mike walked to the elevator in his 
gown . 
we got on and there was a kid driving the 
nobody 's allowed to leave here in a gown , 
he said . 
you just drive this thing , kid , i said , 
we 'll worry about the gown . 
mike was all puffed-up , triple size 
but i got him into the car somehow 
and gave him a cigarette . 
i stopped at the liquor store for 2 six packs 
then went on in . i drank with mike and his wife until 
then went upstairs . . . 
where 's mike ? i asked his wife 3 days later , 
you know he said he was going to wax my car . 
mike died , she said , he 's gone . 
you mean he died ? i asked . 
yes , he died , she said . 
i 'm sorry , i said , i 'm very sorry 
it rained for a week after that and i figured the only 
way i 'd get the 5 back was to go to bed with his wife 
but you know 
she moved out 2 weeks later 
an old guy with white hair moved in there 
and he had one blind eye and played the french horn . 
there was no way i could make it with 
him . 
a real one , on the second floor- 
to get to the candy counter in the back , 
and pointed at the red wax lips , 
and walked the streets of beaver , 
our teeth sunk hard in the wax , 
and big red lips worth kissing . 
the whole trick of this thing ... is to get out of your own light . 
she said she sang very close to the mike 
to change the space . and i changed the space 
as if you 're inside my head and you 're hearing the song from in there . 
he came from the desert , i came 
from green suburbs . we understood 
nothing of one another over glasses of metallic red wine . 
i was playing girl . he played 
and light hair , his broad shoulders and hunger 
burned his fingers on june 's smoldering lyre 
was dim and narrow and no , 
the story did n't slide that way though there are many ways 
to throw oneself away . 
one singer did it by living by a broken wall 
until she shredded her voice but still she offered each song , 
plastic bottles a torn shirt fractured dolls 
sometimes the way to milk and honey is through the body . 
sometimes the way in is a song . 
and beauty . 
to enter stone , be water . 
to rise through hard earth , be plant 
to enter fire , be dry . 
to enter life , be food . 
at times it is like watching a face you have just met , 
trying to decide who it reminds you of- 
no one , surely , whom you ever hated or loved , 
but yes , somebody , somebody . you watch the face 
as it turns and nods , showing you , at certain angles , 
a curve of the lips or a lift of the eyebrow 
that is exactly right , and still the lost face 
a sound in the voice , the accent on certain words- 
yes ! a phrase . . . you barely recall sitting outside , 
a couple of syllables that could possibly be 
a little like something you may once have heard . 
pounding your brain . days later a face occurs to you , 
and yes , there is a resemblance . that odd word , though , 
or phrase , is gone . it must have been somebody else . 
yes , it 's like that , at times ; something is , maybe ; 
and there are days when you can almost say what it is . 
the opposite of walk ? 
who sees green 
when your palm is read . 
at the sign of a red palm 
i do n't walk , 
i run . 
only its darkness . 
from the deep 
dark a voice calls like a voice in sleep 
slowly a strange name in a strange tongue . 
as leaves stir faintly on the ground 
a stir a sigh 
nobody will ever know 
i came here for a reason 
perhaps there is a life here 
of not being afraid of your own heart beating 
do not be afraid of your own heart beating 
look at very small things with your eyes 
& amp ; stay warm 
nothing outside can cure you but everything 's outside 
there is great shame for the world in knowing 
you may have gone this far 
perhaps this is why you love the presence of other people so much 
you have nothing more to teach 
until there is no more panic at the knowledge of your own real existence 
& amp ; then only special childish laughter to be shown 
& amp ; no more lies no more 
not to find you no 
more coming back & amp ; more returning 
southern journey 
small things & amp ; not my own debris 
something to fight against 
our own ideas of food , a wild sauce 
there 's not much point in its being over : but we do not speak them : 
and then i panicked most at the sound of what the wind could do 
to me 
if i crawled back to the house , two feet give no position , if 
the branches cracked over my head & amp ; their threatening me , if i 
if i suffered what else could i do 
when i was a boy , a relative 
asked for me a job 
at the weeks cemetery . 
think of all i could 
have raised that summer , 
that money , and me 
living at home , 
ready to live my life 
out on my knees , humming , 
dead of whom we make 
so much . 
i could have stayed there with them . 
cheap , too . 
imagine , never 
to have turned 
cold , the hill , so laid 
a way to make a living . 
thank you , no . 
of measure from a dark blue 
ripple on swell on ripple that makes 
its own garlands . 
my dead are the secret wine jars 
their happiness is a lost beginning , their graves 
one of these days 
will dance up thirty-foot walls of radiance , 
and waken , 
the sea shining on their shoulders , the fresh 
wine in their arms . their ships have drifted away . 
into your hands , love . 
the way to the river leads past the names of 
ash the sleeves the wreaths of hinges 
i lay your name by my voice 
as i go 
the way to the river leads past the late 
doors and the games of the children born looking backwards 
they play that they are broken glass 
the numbers wait in the halls and the clouds 
from windows 
they play that they are old they are putting the horizon 
into baskets they are escaping they are 
my voice turns to you 
windows gallery 
in a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing 
the rivers one 
after the other i begin to know where i am 
i am home 
walk on our letters i can tell 
i have lit our room with a glove of yours be 
here i turn 
to your name and the hour remembers 
its one word 
be here what can we 
do for the dead the footsteps full of money 
i offer you what i have my 
to the city of wires i have brought home a handful 
of water i walk slowly 
in front of me they are building the empty 
ages i see them reflected not for long 
be here i am no longer ashamed of time it is too brief its hands 
have no names 
i have passed it i know 
oh necessity you with the face you with 
all the faces 
plague across vast acres of the land , choking schools 
fear to tread in their wake : : when all known tools 
of resistance are clutched in the hands of the vile 
like a wilting bouquet , cut from their roots , while 
for future use : : when breathing in the ashen traces 
you-are is where-you-were and the sunset groans 
into the atlantic , setting blue fire to dark white bones . 
so many years later , the old dog 
still circles , head lowered , crippled by 
so there we sit on the front steps 
with our friend , and in the car , as always , 
when she senses the doctor 's office 
drawing near , she moans and tries to 
what remains , the memory of how 
she taught us all the way we need 
to learn to live with wasting . 
there we sit , together , one last time 
as all that sweetness slowly disappears . 
but you made every 
delicate , elegant wrist 
& amp ; glistening ankle . 
but you made them 
in braided rope 
& amp ; dime store gold . 
but you made every 
necklace clasp . 
but you made them 
caress the nape 
like an errant wind 
after a shower . 
but you made every 
single strand of hair 
soft . 
but you made them 
from dust & amp ; bone . 
made every glorious 
singing thigh . every 
button nose . 
but you made them 
with holes- 
wide open 
of salt 
in a sea breeze , salt 
in the sweaty mouth 
of a navel , salt 
in the blood , sweet 
in every wrong way . 
i see into them 
as they see out of me 
who needs to be at peace in the world ? it helps to be between wars , to die 
a few times each day to understand your father 's sky , as you take it apart 
piece by piece and ca n't feel anything , ca n't feel the tree growing under 
your feet , the eyes poking night only to find another night to compare it to . 
have n't we grown ? what does it mean to be older ? maybe a house with- 
out doors can still survive a storm . maybe i ca n't find the proper way to 
rebel or damn it , i ca n't leave . i want to , but you grow inside of me . and 
as i watch you , before i know it , i 'm too heavy , too full of you to move . 
maybe that 's what they meant when they said you should n't love a country 
too much . 
we used to like talking about grief 
with losses , complaints , and sorrows . 
even if there was no grief 
as though longing for the charm 
then we could n't help expressing grief 
so many things descended without warning : 
labor wasted , loves lost , houses gone , 
words lined up in our throats 
for a good whining . 
grief seemed like an endless river- 
the only immortal flow of life . 
after losing a land and then giving up a tongue , 
we stopped talking of grief 
we laugh a lot , at our own mess . 
things become beautiful , 
how does beginning go how does 
remembering without forgetting go 
in front of me in the snow a man 
how does beginning go not remembering 
flashes of light that showed him images when he 
was a boy quick and blinding see the shadows 
in the light how does not-remembering go 
listen to the hissing see the light 
and germany 's lightness 
how bright germany is like soot 
like images quick and blinding how does 
beginning go smell the snow 
it 's new it fell in the night 
in the dark gets forgotten 
in images quick listen to the snow 
it lies light like linen 
something 's burning a hissing somber 
like images at night on walls listen 
to the hissing smell the smell of burning 
look at the soot on a white background 
translated from the german 
we are not responsible for your lost or stolen relatives . 
if you can not understand english , you will be moved out of the way . 
in the event of a loss , you 'd better look out for yourself . 
have reason to suspect you are carrying a concealed wallet . 
it 's not our fault you were born wearing a gang color . 
you have no rights we are bound to respect . 
please remain calm , or we ca n't be held responsible 
for what happens to you . 
even though you on the wooden stick 
you live on 
red juice on the lawn clutching candy rushing home 
upside down shredded night 
because of you you 
we march touch hands lean back leap forth 
walk become 
we become somehow 
our breath can not be choked off our 
can not be cut off 
each wrist 
each bone 
can not be chained to the abyss 
killer sheets of steel 
hear us 
we weep & amp ; sing 
as we write 
we are the knife people , iron men , coat people 
and he-lands-sailing . 
as if towns could build themselves . 
as if stumps jumped from the ground or 
long-necked trees and tongues of land , 
suffering snakes that may fly , wolves 
kingdom of corn and thorny promise . 
to satisfy our appetite of spirit , 
our thirst of property . 
to seek not the opera of war but 
while my baby brother takes out his eight-ball 
to line up his shot 
on the world 's smallest pool table . 
mother has a camera for a head ; 
though she claims to have run 
out of film a hundred years ago , 
when father 's penis , 
shuffling out of her hiding place 
in the cuckoo clock , her hair a mess 
in her arms-sighs 
to pass the time . 
water seeps through the ceiling , 
because upstairs 
grandma has forgotten 
the bath she 's drawn , 
and on the stove the gas is high , the flames 
boil , boil , loyal rubble , 
follow me to the end of my life . 
my heart is a fancy place 
& amp ; white ones in french & amp ; english are outside 
waiting to welcome you to a boat 
over the low black river for a big dinner 
even a tortured lamb served in pieces 
of clouds blown over the cold filthy river 
and cigarette case , 
on a leash : drag it , 
we did what could not 
gain us a week of rent or even a plate of fish , 
yet we managed to eat 
though , and i am sorry , she had bought us wine . 
once , in the chamber 
before an evening concert , i hid a sack of bees 
in the white baby grand , 
and felt a little less dreary 
and a little less proud of being bored . 
we have not long to love . 
light does not stay . 
the tender things are those 
we fold away . 
for common wear . 
in silence i have watched you 
comb your hair . 
intimate the silence , 
dim and warm . 
i could but did not , reach 
to touch your arm . 
i could , but do not , break 
that which is still . 
would be shrill . ) 
so moments pass as though 
they wished to stay . 
we have not long to love . 
a night . a day ... . 
but not enough , we opposed them but not 
enough . i was 
in my bed , around my bed america 
was falling : invisible house by invisible house by invisible house . 
i took a chair outside and watched the sun . 
in the sixth month 
in the street of money in the city of money in the country of money , 
our great country of money , we ( forgive us ) 
lived happily during the war . 
he danced with tall grass 
for a moment , like he was swaying 
glowed white-hot . 
when i got to him , 
a blue halo 
of flies had already claimed him . 
i pulled the crumbled photograph 
from his fingers . 
there 's no other way 
to say this : i fell in love . 
the morning cleared again , 
except for a distant mortar 
i slid the wallet into his pocket 
& amp ; turned him over , so he would n't be 
kissing the ground . 
white shoes . we 
eat mall . we 
soak teeth . we 
palm beach ; we 
vote red . we 
soon dead . 
that ball , i got to it , i just 
could n't come up with it . 
would n't even get close 
wants you to know he 's only 
human : we 're human beings . 
that 's why we 're here . if not , 
i would have wings . 
i 'd be beside god right now . 
i 'd be an angel . 
but i 'm not an angel . 
i 'm a human being that lives right here . 
next day , all 
i 'm a human being that lives right here , decided 
has explained to me , has laid out in clean 
even rows of logic 
how every atom in my body 
arrived from a star , a star 
that blasted apart , 
and the atoms of my left hand 
than my right , 
i can shine . i can go dark 
recalling how my grandfather made 
the vertical blinds rattle 
my grandmother into them . 
startled in the yard , i turned to that sound , 
from the flower bed my eyes were held by 
the swaying blinds . it took a while for each 
to line up 
perfectly straight again , to tell myself 
she slipped . only then could i 
return to stalking the butterflies . 
my right hand was quick : reach and pinch . 
i had so many soft wings that summer 
between my thumb and index , so many of them 
i was a kid . i was cruel slash gentle . 
he was cruel slash gentle . 
and i saw 
inside the white envelope of a flower . 
under the sun it glowed . under the moon , 
more glowing . 
the pool players . 
seven at the golden shovel . 
we real cool . we 
left school . we 
strike straight . we 
sing sin . we 
thin gin . we 
jazz june . we 
die soon . 
than we do 
when it 's all 
wound down . 
i do n't know 
why we settle 
to the sound . 
the regular 
click and chime 
of passing time , 
like water , turns 
a water wheel 
that turns a gear 
that turns a stone 
that turns upon 
another stone 
and fine 
and finer in between 
our dreams like grain 
are ground . 
we wear the mask that grins and lies , 
it hides our cheeks and shades our eyes , - 
this debt we pay to human guile ; 
with torn and bleeding hearts we smile , 
why should the world be over-wise , 
in counting all our tears and sighs ? 
nay , let them only see us , while 
we wear the mask . 
we smile , but , o great christ , our cries 
to thee from tortured souls arise . 
we sing , but oh the clay is vile 
beneath our feet , and long the mile ; 
but let the world dream otherwise , 
we wear the mask ! 
that town stood beside , built two rooms 
and called them home . my henry did that . 
there . and i lived all those days inside his love . 
but there is a kind of hunger that feeds 
on flesh . only , let it be yearning , heaving , 
rising flesh . only , let it be flesh living 
and loving . alive . let it be life . 
there is a kind of hunger that feeds on life . 
they carved into him with banquet knives , 
made stew of his skin and stirred it 
with his own bones . my henry served : the meat 
and the pot to cook it in . and there was no charge 
against the men who made that meal . 
we the people , we the one 
too many grass blades to count , 
the whole field swaying from here to that shy 
blue mountain . swaying 
as in rocking , but also the other 
than a real field , portrait of the people 
unmoved . you know that shooting last week ? 
i will admit the number dead 
was too low to startle me 
if you admit you felt the same , 
and the person standing by you 
do n't you think ? to really 
shake up your afternoon ? i 'm troubled by 
if you care to know , five still 
even if you do n't . i 'm angry 
i 'm getting used to it , the daily 
that wo n't make a noise , i 'm thinking every gun 
should come with a microphone , 
we would never sleep , the field 
always awake , acres of swaying 
up to that shy blue mountain , no wonder 
look at us , look with the mountain 's eyes 
we the people 
putting holes in the people . 
how gray and hard the brown feet of the wretched of the earth . 
push themselves through the streets , deep in their lives . 
offering seeds and flowers . 
how lively their conversation together . 
how much of death they know . 
i.deer season 
the quiet of windows pours its sand in my ear . 
what , what ? ask the dolls of evening 
though they do not wish to hear my answer . 
toward the slough . no one here has a rifle 
but the wind turns abruptly and returns a report . 
the doe turns in her frame above the stove , 
and her season climbs like the moon into its place 
in the sky 's clock . the green theater 
in its paper and drinks , while the baby throws 
his feet through the bars , and the father 
and bleached lips read her poems in crisp 
by the way her torso seemed stacked , pressed 
that hung in the bottom of the eye like the bulk 
of a tear that never quite falls . it 's true 
the intelligence was clear as green ice , and just 
as hard , stripped of its i and heat . her baby 
in the poems . oh little rabbit of grief on the spot 
where the last dog was turned under , do n't speak . 
i make a fire , then dream a fire : wind carries 
its gray rags into the woods , and the crackling 
when i look out , the grass along the fence 
press their blue buttons into the cold glass . 
ii.the new year 
zero and a fine hard snow burns 
when it hits bare skin . a white 
ridge glows inside the birches 
the distance . where water moves , 
the splits , my breasts pop and burn , 
and my child 's face rises like a bird 
wind takes the rag of some old self 
and shakes it at me . the heart is only 
another shape the view stretches to include . 
is simply one edge of me . out here 
or to be burned , how much water 's left 
in the tank , how hard or soft the light . 
are mine , and though i try to be selfish and grim , 
more than i , but not quite we . 
so they appear blue . self-luminous , 
the kick of the screw finding purchase in pine 
and another until the wall is flush . i mark 
and cut each length with the small tooth 
i should have . two days apart from him 
and the child , i 've forgotten the pump 
to empty my breasts , so the saw 's jump 
at the end of the cut draws the burning 
up . and with it a guilt as bright as the room 
each a satisfaction against the body 's wish 
to be elsewhere . even into the night , i ca n't put 
in as far as they 'll go . the mind arranging 
which planks and trim tomorrow , next week 
of my breasts . so toward morning i dream 
of parties given by women i used to know , 
and to which i 'm not and will never be invited , 
half moon glasses of seething champagne . 
i used an arrow to kill the spider . 
for the ants i called in an air strike . 
bee that found its way in through the screen : 
a poisoned word thrown to the dog . 
for love , only a kitchen match . that 
and a stove leaking gas 
and waiting until the dinner 
was good and burned . 
amid the glare of light and song 
and talk that knows not when to cease , 
the sullen voices of the throng , 
my weary soul cries out for peace , 
the wash of waters deep and cool , 
the wind too faint for any breath 
to stir oblivion 's silent pool , 
when all who swim against the stream , 
and they that laugh , and they that weep , 
shall change like flowers in a dream 
that wither on the brows of sleep . 
for silence is the song sublime , 
and every voice at last must cease , 
and all the world at evening time 
beyond the gloom of shadowy caves 
where water washes on the stones , 
the stars are what the flowers seem , 
and where the sea of thought is deep , 
the moonlight glitters like a dream , 
on weary waters gone to sleep . 
my grandmother said when she was young 
the grass was so wild and high 
you could n't see a man on horseback . 
in the fields she made out 
three barns , 
dark and blown down from the weather 
like her husbands . 
she remembers them in the dark , 
cursing the beasts , 
and how they would leave the bed 
in the morning , 
the dead grass of their eyes 
stacked against her . 
i was wondering why that guy 
i was wondering why he wore 
or a winter count , its skinny figure 
around belly to back , 
around back to belly- 
i was wondering why , when he said , 
every day , because these things 
are sacred , these things are prayer . 
then i knew i could live this life 
if i had blue horses 
painted around and around me , 
shells and beads like rain in my ear 
praying prairie open in me 
every day every day every day . 
the weather is hot on the back of my watch 
who is gifted with 3 balls 
but no heart , but you 've got to understand 
when the bull goes down 
on the whore , the heart is laid aside for something else , 
some wobbly king of 6 kids 
and who is to say the rose is greater than the thorn ? 
not i , henry , 
maybe you should have stuck it into something else 
like an oil well 
or a herd of cows . 
i 'm too old to argue , 
i 've gone with the poem 
and been k.o . 'd with the old sucker-punch 
round after round , 
or eliot with his trousers rolled ; 
the weather is hot on the back of my watch 
but you know what they say : things are tough all over , 
and i remember once on the bum in texas 
and the crows came down half-dead , half-living , 
but they ran out of shells before they ran out of crows 
stuck out their tongues 
and then all at once flew home to fuck to fill the gap . 
you can only kill what should n't be there . 
and maybe myself , and i realize that if the poems are bad 
they are supposed to be bad and if they are good 
they are likewise supposed to be-although there is a minor 
fight to be fought , 
but still i am sad 
way off course , not even wanting to be there , 
two dollars in my wallet , and a farmer turned to me 
and asked me what time it was 
and i would n't tell him , 
and later they gathered them up for burning 
as if they were no better than dung with feathers , 
feathers and a little gasoline , 
and from the bottom of one pile 
a not-quite-dead crow smiled at me . 
it was 4:35 p.m . 
when it snows , he stands 
at the back door or wanders 
around the house to each 
window in turn and 
watches the weather 
like a lover . o farm boy , 
i waited years 
for you to look at me 
that way . now we 're old 
enough to stop waiting 
for random looks or touches 
or words , so i find myself 
watching you watching 
the weather , and we wait 
together to discover 
whatever the sky might bring . 
and laid its eggs on our only tree . 
we did not want to send it away . 
we watched the building of the nest 
they say it came from the west 
where the storms at sea had felled the gulls 
and our new horizon limits at its nest . 
we look for new homes every day , 
sidewalks of webs and weeds 
to that old house where we stayed . 
against the cracks of weeds and webs . 
they yelled his name like a tribal curse 
against that background of sights and smells , 
shattered by cops in that place without trees . 
among cousins and sidewalks of webs and weeds . 
that halloween i wore your wedding dress , 
i 'd never felt so sensual before- 
you were my shy groom . love , i was your bride . 
thou god , whose high , eternal love 
is the only blue sky of our life , 
clear all the heaven that bends above 
the life-road of this man and wife . 
may these two lives be but one note 
in the world 's strange-sounding harmony , 
whose sacred music e'er shall float 
as when from separate stars two beams 
as when two sweet but shadowy dreams 
explain each other in the day : 
so may these two dear hearts one light 
let an angel come and dwell tonight 
in this dear double-heart , and teach . 
yesterday afternoon , i hung a framed print in the living room- 
a task that took two head-throbbing hours . 
but still feel love so deeply as their bones turned into dust ? 
i want to believe that those paintings were composed 
that passed through a window . 
the knots in my back might not be there 
and i could well have done without two hours of silence 
over a few holes in the wall . 
but somehow , life has its ways of working things out . 
this afternoon , i shut the blinds , 
turned off the tv , lights , and phone , 
her second one this week despite 
for once , i 'd like to experience what she feels : 
fill with blood , leak , and make the brain swell . 
for now , we have our room , the bed frame , and the mattress 
the breeze stirring the lemon , lime , and orange trees 
that i planted along the back fence . 
on certain nights , the moon turns our lawn 
until all we know is the sound 
of our breathing among the whispering leaves . 
my wedding-ring lies in a basket 
as if at the bottom of a well . 
nothing will come to fish it back up 
and onto my finger again . 
it lies 
among keys to abandoned houses , 
nails waiting to be needed and hammered 
into some wall , 
telephone numbers with no names attached , 
it ca n't be given away 
for fear of bringing ill-luck 
it ca n't be sold 
for the marriage was good in its own 
time , though that time is gone . 
beat into it bright stones , transform it 
living will not let them keep ? change it 
into a simple gift i could give in friendship ? 
weep you no more , sad fountains ; 
what need you flow so fast ? 
look how the snowy mountains 
heaven 's sun doth gently waste . 
but my sun 's heavenly eyes 
view not your weeping , 
that now lie sleeping 
softly , now softly lies 
sleeping . 
doth not the sun rise smiling 
when fair at even he sets ? 
rest you then , rest , sad eyes , 
melt not in weeping 
while she lies sleeping 
softly , now softly lies 
sleeping . 
what the scale tells you is how much the earth 
has missed you , body , how it wants you back 
again after you leave it to go forth 
into the light . do you remember how 
earth hardly noticed you then ? others would rock 
you in their arms , warm in the flow 
and your poems and your obedient blood . 
body , how useful you became , how lucky , 
sometimes , imagining that greedy zero 
you must have been , that promising empty sack 
of possibilities , never-to-come tomorrow . 
but look at you now , body , soft old shoe 
that love wears when it 's stirring , look down , look 
how earth wants what you weigh , needs what you know . 
night and day . in the night and in the day 
wet from heat and the chill of the wind 
and the taste of bay in the shadowed air . 
the dignity of being . they slept that way , 
knowing each other always . 
fences were nothing compared to that . 
people were nothing . they slept standing , 
they breathed against each other , 
there are things they did that i do not know . 
the privacy of them had a river in it . 
had our universe in it . and the way 
its border looks back at us with its light . 
this was finally their freedom . 
the freedom an oak tree knows . 
that is built at night by stars . 
the well rising without sound , 
the spring on a hillside , 
everywhere in the field- 
hunting for the final curve 
coming closer and closer- 
with care in such a world . 
but came out with a baby - i had n't noticed 
the house was pregnant , she said - 
it was crying , so i cried back - 
then she cried , the woman i barely know 
after sixteen years - why just the other day , 
she told me she 'd always been afraid 
# 2 pencils might be made 
of what they 're named - but even crying 
it was cute - pink and scrunchy-eyed - 
it was as if the universe decided 
it was time to act our age - that 's 
took the high-wire down and stopped 
and as much as i miss yelling pull 
when it fills with swamp-gas or whatever 
that is - the miracle , you know , of birth 
is that my wife and i gave up hang gliding 
of the beast who showed up and took over - 
every other future she might have lived 
but one - long before i could speak , 
i was cruel - for a few seconds , 
i let my mother believe i was everything 
she ever wanted - and even now , decades after 
my few perfect seconds as a baby , if i called , 
at the first unexpected brush of hey , ma 
by the tidal pull of my voice 
on the ghost of a womb they long ago 
ripped out , that she was holding 
a full moon in her arms

fitting right into the city 
smiling when a pretty woman passed him 
the new york times . 
i 'd recognize him anywhere

people say 
you can dress 'em up 
but once a coyote 
always a coyote . 
rather than hold his hands properly 
arched off the keys , like cats 
with their backs up , 
monk , playing block chords , 
hit the keys with his fingertips well 
above his wrists , 
shoulders up , wrists down , scarce 
room for the pencil , ground 
freshly to a point , 
piano teachers love to poke 
print teaching dresses 
then free me from the couch . 
the wisdom in rocky mount , 
sphere , came later , but nobody 's 
sure : he made his escape 
by turning himself into a genius 
in broad daylight while nobody 
watched . just a weird little black 
kid one day and next thing anybody 
knew he was inexplicable 
and gone . we do n't give lessons 
for lessons . it works for a while . 
think of all the time we spend 
thinking about our kids . 
we might think on , and everyone 
we pay to tend our young , opaque 
not yet ready to replace us , 
or escape us , if that be the work . 
-no matter how much 
muscle i might have 
mustered-my mother 
was like to come along 
behind , reach around 
me to take it up again 
from where i 'd left it , 
lift it back into my line 
of vision and in one 
practiced motion from 
hands and thin air work 
a second miraculous 
into the day 's last gleam . . . 
have you been in our wild west country ? then 
you have often had to pass 
the wild green prairie grass . 
have you seen the women forget their wheels 
as they sat at the door to spin- 
from their fingers worn and thin , 
as they asked you news of the villages 
where they were used to be , 
with their lovers gone to sea ! 
that no loud praise provokes- 
of poor , hard-working folks ! 
of the little more , and the little more 
upon their own tired hands to make 
the toil for the children less : 
and not in vain ; for many a lad 
born to rough work and ways , 
strips off his ragged coat , and makes 
men clothe him with their praise . 
you find yourself in a narrow bed you 've never slept in , 
on a tree-lined grassy field you 've never walked upon , 
on a cold toilet seat you have not sat on , 
in a place you now call your home , your learning , your future . 
the knowledge you seek , 
and the information you want to gather . 
you crane your neck to look up 
at the 13-story brick tower rising from the ground , 
and beats of different songs mix , 
create a sound of their own , 
you pull your jacket tighter against your body , 
strong , salty wind whips off the sound , 
and up the hill as you walk through 
red square toward the clatter of knives , 
finally , you are released like a white dove 
from the hands of its owner , allowed to fly 
finish , lie dead on the sorrow bed . stiff and related 
your heart . from machine with this wake , this egg 
begin , your main ( ) with her . peace , walking through city 
pulses , end their made up western , singing its shore borrowed 
that has hers . win there - placed like dirt on the shoe 
made pins . on then to an eye full of tunnels , real i/o 
the whale that wanders round the pole 
is not a table fish . 
you can not bake or boil him whole , 
nor serve him in a dish ; 
and melt it down for oil , 
( a product of the soil ) . 
who wants to be a don . 
the 14-year-old girl was treated like : 
( a ) a grown woman . 
( b ) a grown man . 
the bikini-clad girl was handled by the cop like : 
the girl was slung to the ground like : 
( b ) somebody had something to prove . 
the girl 's braids flew around her head like : 
( b ) she 'd been slapped . 
the black girl was pinned to the ground like : 
( b ) swimming in a private pool is a threat to national security . 
the girl 's cries sounded like : 
a guy comes walking out of the garden 
we 're sitting on the porch , 
drinking and spitting , lying . 
we shut our eyes , snap our fingers . 
like he does n't believe what he 's seeing 
and brings back three-half-pints . 
carrying dust away like a pail of water . 
we 're drinking serious now , and o.z . 
wants to break in the store for some head cheese , 
but the others wo n't let him . 
everybody laughs , dances . 
things are dying down , the moon spills its water . 
o.z . says if it rains he 'll still make a crop . 
we wait there all night , looking for rain . 
we have n't been to sleep , so the blue lizards 
on the side of the white porch 
lose their tails when we try to dream . 
the man playing the music looks at us , 
noticing what we 're up to . he backs off , 
holding up his hands in front , smiling , 
shaking his head , but before he gets half way 
down the road that o.z . shoots him in the belly . 
what are you on ? 
he or she would have answered 
whereas today it means 
are you taking ? 
( are you taking has less energy 
and today what are you on about ? 
would have sounded like 
and will 
you on ? 
a hole in whatever is going to be 
so i can slip through 
and not have arms and legs all the time 
that 's o.k . neither am i though both 
and fain would lie down 
we ride on 
and did n't understand until last night or was it this morning 
i take one in the morning and one in the evening 
some day people will look back 
how backward they were 
the way some look back now 
but primitive life was so dirty how 
could you keep things clean ? 
not knowing that tribal people 
lived in the garden of eden 
that is they had more humanity 
than later people 
so that those people who look back at earth 
some day from a distant galaxy 
will not be people at all 
they will be cue balls 
is shining onto my house and the trees 
are feeling like their tops because they are still in the garden of eden 
that is the gentle endless hush 
of an endless mother to her endless newborn child 
things are there 
covered with sparkles 
that have nothing to do with sunlight 
the way one night i got out of bed and found 
that i was covered with sparkles very small ones 
i wondered if i would be covered with sparkles the rest of my life 
and if other people had them 
but these are not the same sparkles that things have on them 
except the ocean sometimes at night 
by day the ocean moves away from where it was 
but a mountain does not 
somewhere in between lies hidden valley 
where grandpa comes out of his cabin 
then goes back inside 
of fresh hot biscuits 
but she will give him none 
give me some biscuits he cries 
but she smiles and shakes her head 
grandpa sits down at the table 
even though he sees it in the cup before him 
that 's how the day begins in hidden valley 
but where are the grandchildren 
they are scattered about the world in jagged pieces 
that move like birds in spring 
someday they will return to hidden valley 
and form another mountain 
to make hidden valley even more hidden 
when the waterfall closes over it 
you think i do n't know where it is 
you are like the guy who looked all over 
for his hat and later learned it was on his head 
but it did n't mean anything until he realized he had a head 
and that the hat was both on and inside it 
and when he did 
it was not a rabbit that he pulled out 
you do n't want to be that guy , do you ? 
you would rather be the rabbit 
when all along you could have been the waterfall 
we move ahead in our story to five years later 
then we move five years back 
because there is no story 
only a collection of events with no beginning , 
no end , and therefore no middle , it is all 
one big beginning , middle , and end every second 
and though you are in it you are also to the side 
like an actor waiting in the wings for the cue 
that will cause the stage to light up and expand 
though it is also the cue for the audience to rise 
and head for the exits , because they are the real players 
and you , it turns out , are part of the scenery 
propped up against a wall , gathering dust along your top ridge , 
and placed among the other mountains 
-where no man had ever set foot- 
and there it is 
his face 
on the front of his head 
and her face coming off her head 
and starting toward him 
because she knew right then his head 
would be severed from his body 
but what she did not know 
is that he too would end up in hidden valley 
raining down his sparkles upon the house of grandma and grandpa 
are you enjoying your vacation 
yes i am 
in fact so much that i do n't even think of it as a vacation or as 
anything else 
and come to think of it i do n't even think of it 
it 's just the way things are 
how about you 
yes i too am enjoying my vacation 
well good 
what you just said about your vacation i 'm not sure i understand 
what you mean 
i did n't mean much of anything i guess 
the mountains around here have a way of making me not think very 
maybe because they are n't thinking at all who knows 
and i tend to become like whatever i 'm around 
but you 're always around air do you turn into air 
yes i 'm always air 
what about grandma and grandpa are you turning into them 
no i ca n't turn into them i already am them 
well that is very interesting 
and a fine day to you as well 
ireland rose up on the horizon 
but hidden valley was too powerful it made ireland sink back down 
though the voices of ireland could be heard in the distance 
for he wished to sing himself 
as he found them to be beautiful and moving- 
you could see when you looked up into his eyes 
not long after you were born 
the sky at night 
the kind you would find only in new york city 
when it was in black and white 
the horrible big guys could n't catch him 
and hurled the big guys down and one-two-three boom 
they were pinned 
and once more he smiled 
at people like us out in the middle of nowhere 
it 's time for bed it 's way past time 
and it was 
but we were hidden outside of time 
and no one would know 
because they were visible inside of time 
i was happy in hidden valley happy enough 
and i 'm happy i once lived there 
maybe i 'll find myself there again someday 
even though the mountains will be gone 
and the rest changed beyond all recognition 
my memory of a perfect scent : pine , sage , and cypress ; 
my friends ' faith in the power of rough and winding paths 
to take me up a mountain and bring me back . 
how i got them is a story of friendship and passion 
her husband mike , the second , better one , and their obsession 
next to two-story garden apartments down the street from a 
mansion . 
long hair , 
there are those who fight about the wind . others the sun . 
political power . 
valley beauty . 
high desert heat is clear , dry and when your body rises out of a 
chilly car , 
a general store at the edge of mountain lore . 
i almost bought a foot long sausage . i almost bought a gun . 
food and security . winter just over the ridge , four weeks hence . 
i used to watch death valley days . 
the wagon train a going . 
o , those long-suffering white people fearful of indians and scared of 
desperate for shade , for water , for land flowing milk and honey . 
what they got was land just green enough for wandering herds of 
long-horned beasts 
and no where to farm , no where to hide . 
today , the wind machines whip around : big energy . 
a few miles up from sun valley , we enter a trail . 
their walking sticks to the rocks ' ready 
challenge to ankles and limbs . 
what were my friends thinking ? 
we slip and slide on the side of this mountain and step aside 
fast as 
nancy and mike 's favorite dog 
she runs ahead following the blonde beauties until all is shadow . 
we greet each other with glee . 
one large black woman with a bum knee . what were they 
thinking ? 
she will love the smell . pine , sage , and cypress . 
when friends give you what you need , what more can you ask ? 
oh the pleasure in a mountain 's power to quiet a panicked heart . 
the glade refined . 
hawk 's home , wolf 's dream , bears far away . 
in wild places 
-the rise and fall of future walks . 
mountain , 
where people steal 
a drop of ore , 
a native flower , 
a piece of splendor 
day in and day out . 
what became of the dear 
strands of hair pressed 
of your lover 's brow 
into the world of those eyes , 
now only yours ? 
what became of any afternoon 
that was so vivid you forgot 
the present was up to its old 
trick of pretending 
it would be there 
always ? 
what became of the one 
who believed so deeply 
everything in it and left 
it for you ? 
in winter , it is what calls us 
to the end of a long driveway 
where , we hope , it waits- 
this letter , this package , this 
singing of wind around an opened door . 
tea spring water get well cards 
cotton t-shirts lawn furniture a new baby 
counting with her breathing for her will 
watching tv not watching tv prayer 
prayer prayer prayer 
i want a red dress . 
i want it flimsy and cheap , 
i want it too tight , i want to wear it 
until someone tears it off me . 
this dress , so no one has to guess 
what 's underneath . i want to walk down 
with all those keys glittering in the window , 
i want to walk like i 'm the only 
woman on earth and i can have my pick . 
i want that red dress bad . 
your worst fears about me , 
to show you how little i care about you 
or anything except what 
i want . when i find it , i 'll pull that garment 
to carry me into this world , through 
the birth-cries and the love-cries too , 
and i 'll wear it like bones , like skin , 
dress they bury me in . 
you know , the white guy 
who comes to tell 
the black family 
not to move to the 
white chicago suburb . 
the man who smiles 
with the knife , 
who is a knife , 
but fools them for 
a second , because 
they 're looking at him 
the way he expects 
them to look at him . 
later , as they mop 
what he said : that he 
because he 's the guy that 
can get his foot in the door , 
since he popped out of his 
mother 's womb , like he 's a 
close , personal friend of sorry . 
this is the way the knife 
gets through the door , and 
he sits there , as they 
think , maybe he ai n't a 
a small part of them , quietly 
embarrassed they 're even 
thinking that about him . 
they can barely hold their 
manners in check , and that 's 
his trick , the trick of the knife 
you do n't see until you 're cut . 
about this , the damn thing 
is how meek he still looks 
after he cuts , and cuts again . 
he is singing the song of his 
brood ; money if you stay , 
fire if you come , as they think : 
apologize . 
even though the laws have changed 
my grandmother still takes us 
to the back of the bus when we go downtown 
in the rain.it 's easier , my grandmother says , 
than having white folks look at me like i 'm dirt . 
but we are n't dirt . we are people 
paying the same fare as other people . 
when i say this to my grandmother , 
she nods , says , easier to stay where you belong . 
i look around and see the ones 
who walk straight to the back . see 
anyone to make them move . and know 
this is who i want to be . not scared 
like that . brave 
like that . 
still , my grandmother takes my hand downtown 
wherever we want now.no need in making trouble , 
she says.you all go back to new york city but 
i have to live here . 
with mirage . in the back seat 
we were not poor but we had 
the troubles of the poor . 
was gone , somewhere , somewhere 
there was a bay , there was a boat , 
what i remember best 
is the way everything came and went 
in the window of my brief attention . 
at the wake i was beguiled 
the hearse rolled forward over the o 's 
of its own surprise . 
what horror to awake at night 
time is white 
mosquitoes bite 
i 've spent my life on nothing . 
sitting around with something 's wife . 
buzz and burn 
is all i learn 
i 've spent my life on nothing . 
lifting household stuffing- 
carpets , dishes 
benches , fishes 
i 've spent my life in nothing . 
i carried my fear of the world 
to my children , but they refused it . 
i carried my fear of the world 
on my chest , where i once carried 
my children , where some nights it slept 
i carried my fear of the world 
i carried my fear of the world 
and it became my teacher . 
by teaching me how to carry it . 
i carried my fear of the world 
the way an animal carries a kill in its jaws 
but in reverse : i was the kill , the gift . 
whose feet would i be left at ? 
i carried my fear of the world 
as if it could protect me from the world . 
i carried my fear of the world 
at its beauty but keeping my hands still- 
keeping my eyes on its mouth , its teeth . 
i carried my fear of the world . 
i stroked it or i did not dare to stroke it . 
i carried my fear of the world 
and it became my teacher . 
it taught me how to keep quiet and still 
i carried my fear of the world 
and my love for the world . 
i carried my terrible awe . 
i carried my fear of the world 
without knowing how to set it down . 
i carried my fear of the world 
down hard to taste me , part of me 
i carried my fear of the world 
and it taught me i had been right . 
i carried it and loved it 
for making me right . 
i carried my fear of the world 
and it taught me how to carry it . 
i carried my fear of the world 
to my children and laid it down 
at their feet , a kill , a gift . 
or i was laid at their feet . 
to my chest .

i learned from my mother how to love 
in case you have to rush to the hospital 
with peonies cut from the lawn , black ants 
still stuck to the buds . i learned to save jars 
large enough to hold fruit salad for a whole 
grieving household , to cube home-canned pears 
and flick out the sexual seeds with a knife point . 
of the living , to look in their eyes and offer 
sympathy , as though i understood loss even then . 
i learned that whatever we say means nothing , 
what anyone will remember is that we came . 
i learned to believe i had the power to ease 
like a doctor , i learned to create 
you know how to do this , you can never refuse . 
to every house you enter , you must offer 
healing : a chocolate cake you baked yourself , 
the blessing of your voice , your chaste touch . 
when it comes to clothes , make 
be sure the spare in the trunk 
but no matter how angry a man gets , a smile 
wonders . i learned that male chests 
also have nipples , warm and established-

gets to go with him , her tiny hands

where the cook is already boiling the last sail . 
the body itself when it has finally reached 
and from which it nonetheless feels the need to move on 
and to words , which result from an instinct 
for what is impossible : 
to soften the blow for others , including ourselves . 
what is staying alive ? to possess 
a great hall inside of a cell . 
what is it to know ? the same root 
underneath the branches . 
until relief takes over . 
and to forgive ? on fours through thorns 
to keep company to an old enemy . 
what is it to sing ? to receive breath 
from the genius of creation . 
what 's work but humming a song 
from wood and wheat . 
what are state affairs ? a craft 
that 's still only crawling ? 
in a baby 's fist . 
being a nation ? what can it be ? a gift 
in the swell of the heart . 
and to love a country ? keeping house 
in a cloud of witnesses . 
what 's the world to the all powerful ? 
a circle spinning . 
and to the children of the earth ? 
a cradle rocking . 
after three weeks of hot weather and drought , 
we 've had a week of cold and rain , 
just the way it ought to be here in the north , 
all day long , so you can go outside in the cold 
the wood smoke in the air . 
this is the way i love it . this is why 
i came here almost 
fifty years ago . what is june anyway 
without cold and rain 
and a fire going in the stove all day ? 
i have no idea what priests 
dream of on christmas eve , what prayer 
a crippled dog might whine before the shotgun . 
i have no more sense of what is sacred 
than a monk might have , sweeping the temple 
floor , slow gestures of honor to the left , 
the right . maybe the leaf of grass tells us 
perhaps a sacred moment is a photograph 
you look at over and over again , the one 
of you and her , hands lightly clasped like you 
did before prayer became necessary , the one 
with the sinking cathedral in mexico city rising up 
to the right of you , the moment when she touched 
your bare arm for the first time , her fingers 
like cool flashes of heaven . 
and if all those who meet or even 
hear of you become witness to what you are- 
a white country of blight beneath the last snows of 
spring . could we remain quiet on earth 
and bear it , the war we make inside 
what is-it 's a long time to be here , to be still , 
at the edge of a field where we are once again 
taken from ourselves . could we remain here , 
to claim or know . it comes into any mind that would 
the confused animals fling themselves , and you , 
obscure , receive no response that is not suffered 
come to seem the natural course of things- 
what trees whose creatures stray into space- 
struggles open-no answer , no resolution- 
a window opened to the mute green world , 
what we might be against what we have done , 
bees crawling through the lips of the one 
who would say the earth turned into sour flesh- 
what strange rooms , what soundless movement of sky 
over desert where the flesh again is beaten 
and the emptiness extends itself while some old man 
ourselves in the afternoons , evenings , 
weak , vague , clutched at the mouth- 
because we did nothing , because we lost count . 
let us tunnel 
through the rubble , 
let us rut through the sum 
of who we were , 
or are , 
or will be in the years to come : 
a couple 
who used to be in love . 
the sea bit , 
as they said it would , 
and the hill slid , 
as they said it would , 
and the poor dead 
the poor head . 
tower of troy , 
the poem apparently 
speaks with joy 
of terrible things . 
where is the pleasure 
the poetry brings ? 
tell if you can , 
what does it make ? 
a city of man 
that will not shake , 
or if it shake , 
shake with the splendor 
of the poem 's pleasure . 
they look so beautifully abandoned , even in use . 
dried up , i say they look like pirate ships , 
and i think of that walk in the valley where 
no . i believe in this connection we all have 
to nature , to each other , to the universe . 
and she said , yeah , god . and how we stood there , 
low beasts among the white oaks , spanish moss , 
its clouds in simple animal shapes we could name 
though we knew they were really just clouds- 
be the mistress of my choice , 
clean in manners , clear in voice ; 
be she witty , more than wise , 
pure enough , though not precise ; 
be she showing in her dress , 
like a civil wilderness , 
order in a sweet neglect ; 
be she rolling in her eye , 
an enchantment , or a snare , 
but herself held fast by none . 
be she such , as neither will 
what lips my lips have kissed , and where , and why , 
i have forgotten , and what arms have lain 
under my head till morning ; but the rain 
is full of ghosts tonight , that tap and sigh 
upon the glass and listen for reply , 
and in my heart there stirs a quiet pain 
will turn to me at midnight with a cry . 
thus in the winter stands the lonely tree , 
nor knows what birds have vanished one by one , 
yet knows its boughs more silent than before : 
i can not say what loves have come and gone , 
i only know that summer sang in me 
a little while , that in me sings no more . 
even in the half light ; if the mosaic saint 
worn by the gravity of solid soles , the passing 
and if 
the mother , hiding with her child from 
if she , trying to keep the child 
quiet , to keep them from being found out , 
holds her hand over his mouth , holds him 
against her , tighter and tighter , until he stops 
breathing ; 
if the restorer-trying to bring back 
by mistake , the mysterious smile . . . 
if what 
to preserve , 
then here is the place to fall 
silent , meaning well but in danger 
to do more than wear down the marble 
steps to the altar , smother the fire 
we would keep from the wind 's extinction , 
or if , afraid 
of our fear , we lift the lid from the embers , and send 
abroad , into the parched night , a flight of sparks , 
to cold , and to ash . . . 
did a slave song at a master 's bidding 
mark tom while asleep in charity 's womb ? 
after work sprung from dawn and dragged past dusk , 
charity threw feet , hips , arms into motion 
to please the tyrant piano . was it here 
tom learned how music can prove the master ? 
hammer he nailed our address to a stump with , 
is that him , waving from the stern ? well , good luck to him . 
white blossoming , it 's a curve , it comes back . my mother 
her needle again , her eye lifts to the roof , to my brother , 
against the blue-good luck to it-my sister and i below , 
heads tilted back as we stand in the grass , good 
luck to all of us , still here , still in love with it . 
this person would be an animal . 
this animal would be large , at least as large 
having several stomachs . 
no one could follow it 
into the dense brush to witness 
would be of a high order , 
and it would purr , though of course , 
it being a house , you would sit in its lap , 
not it in yours . 
-i dreamt of my father 
he says 
he was riding in an oak coffin 
i walked next to the hearse 
and father turned to me : 
and the funeral is very beautiful 
at this time of year so many flowers 
it must have cost a lot 
do n't worry about it father 
-i say-let people see 
we loved you 
that we spared nothing 
father thought for a while 
and said-the key to the desk 
there is still some money 
in the second drawer on the left 
with this money-i say- 
a large one of black marble 
it is n't necessary-says father- 
better give it to the poor 
they carry burning lanterns 
again he seemed to be thinking 
-take care of the flowers in the garden 
cover them for the winter 
i do n't want them to be wasted 
you are the oldest-he says- 
from a little felt bag behind the painting 
let them bring you luck 
my mother gave them to me 
when i finished high school 
then he did n't say anything 
he must have entered a deeper sleep 
this is how our dead 
look after us 
they warn us through dreams 
bring back lost money 
hunt for jobs 
or when they ca n't do this 
knock with their fingers on the windows 
and out of gratitude 
we imagine immortality for them 
should i hurry ? call the doctor ? a heart like hers is rare . 
and to tell the truth , if it shattered , what would i do ? 
it has long been forgotten this practice of the mother 
she too will share in this act of love 
my own mother says it was not meant 
to be cruel when cruelty she tells me 
is a child 's lips torn from breast as proof 
back home the women wear teeth marks 
not reading english , 
that has n't been translated . 
seeing a cold beer when it 's hot out , 
and not being able to afford it . 
having an idea 
the slate black sky . the middle step 
of the back porch . and long ago 
my mother 's necklace , the beads 
rolling north and south . broken 
the rose stem , water into drops , glass 
years ago the cat 's tail , the bird bath , 
the car hood 's rusted latch . broken 
little finger on my right hand at birth- 
i was pulled out too fast . what has n't 
been rent , divided , split ? broken 
the days into nights , the night sky 
into stars , the stars into patterns 
i make up as i trace them 
with a broken-off blade 
the cricket 's tiny back as i lie 
on the lawn in the dark , my heart 
a blue cup fallen from someone 's hands . 
how often now , raging weeping for the days 
love gives then takes away , takes from you 
you 're pointing at a tree , and the voice 
the finger that taps and feathers your ear 
the days eat into your stomach , knife you 
with longing for relief from love 
that you can not leave or leave alone , 
from its rings of fire where you wo n't 
burn down to ash or be transformed . 
you become them , and they keep burning 
listen how 
their rhymes sing 
the little deaths you live . 
he will not light long enough 
but the longer we listen 
he shows me the place where his daughter 
he thinks he 's been hit by the wind . 
`` what you are struggling with , '' said 
a continuous song , something like 
to give you messages it ca n't deliver . 
he said , `` like a valentine sent 
out cold , beautiful , brittle as tomorrow 's 
these pills will help you 
find yourself 
somewhere where the lace ends up loose 
and the paste is still humming 
all about you . 
what should i say , 
since faith is dead , 
and truth away 
from you is fled ? 
should i be led 
nay , nay , mistress ! 
i promised you , 
and you promised me , 
to be as true 
as i would be . 
but since i see 
your double heart , 
farewell my part ! 
though for to take 
it is not my mind , 
[ one so unkind ] 
and as i find , 
so will i trust : 
farewell , unjust ! 
can ye say nay ? 
but you said 
and thus betrayed 
or that i wiste- 
that when i say love what i mean is not a feeling 
nor promise of a feeling . i believe in attention . 
of attention to large and small objects . she is not 
described by anything . because i could not mean anything else , 
she knows exactly what i mean . 
once upon a time a line saw itself 
clear to its end . i have seen the shape 
of happiness . ( y=mx+b ) 
i am holding it . it is your hand . 
not long ago , i studied medicine . 
it was terrible , what the body told . 
i 'd look inside another person 's mouth , 
because my body speaks the stranger 's language , 
i 've never understood those nods and stares . 
my parents held me in their arms , and still 
and stare , they nod , they make their pilgrimage 
to somewhere distant in my heart , they cry . 
i look inside their other-person 's mouths 
and see the wet interior of souls . 
it 's warm and red in there-like love , with teeth . 
i 've studied medicine until i cried 
remembering the past 
i know the frozen brow 
and shaking sides of lust 
will dog me at my death 
to catch my ghostly breath . 
that lust and love are one . 
the body of this night 
may beggar me to death , 
but we are not undone 
who love with all our breath . 
needs jealousy , and death 
and lust , to make it strong 
to think of sex and death 
and nothing else . why wait 
till we are turning old ? 
my thoughts are hot and cold . 
i do not waste my breath . 
air here is like the water 
of an aquarium that 's been lived in for a while-clear and still 
of glass ; appearing cold ( and clear ) as spring streams 
fed by snow and ice , 
once you come into it , and long bars of light 
burning like spots , 
heavy , as crystal 
is heavy , as if to move here would mean pushing against a force 
with the idea of life , 
beautiful in a way , 
so that the living 
might come to see . harder to say that without them 
we are nothing- 
water without air ; or to speak of our isolation , 
or our special loneliness ; 
or say as they look right through us , at their plants , 
pictures , books , 
windows , reflections , and blank white walls , 
that we need them , 
or that with each look 
they are swimming to within our sights ; or that we are always casting 
wider and wider 
and that even now they are fighting to avoid our nets . 
the mourning dove 
oo-waoh , shadow o- 
through suburb and wood . 
those who hear 
dove moan love no 
the going hence 
about which is there no- 
thing to do ? 
from no small rip in fate 
the you you never shall be 
and starts in , who , 
who is next and soon ? 
there were a house here once , burned , 
this spring the tiny head of a plastic doll- 
not much compared to what they find 
in england , where every now and then 
something , as though nothing we 've 
ever touched wants to stay in the earth , 
or cast away , as though they could n't bear 
the parting , or because they are the only 
messengers from lives that were important once , 
waiting for the power of the frost 
to move them to the mercy of our hands . 
today i saw the word written on the poplar leaves . 
it was 
the wrong words sit beside us 
where the flesh is heavy . 
the right words come most easily 
to those who sleep . 
and my jacket over 
the windshield in the morning 
to confuse the sun . 
of mine own life , i 'll tell you 
one thing the internet 
wo n't tell you-i wear my hair 
like a woman sometimes . 
the project of the snow 's 
to put the sky in lo-fi 
and the memory of last week 's 
the mountains and seas 
have a queer look about them . 
i 've been told 
we should pretend 
that everything we see is real , 
that images should try 
as best they can 
to come to life . i feel that iron 
should take the place of snow 
in the literature 
and that silk flowers 
real ones each spring . 
i 'm reading the letters 
on very good paper . 
and when i step 
of little station in the world 
as though to die were just 
the death and life of weeds 
and to fold oneself 
back into one 's roots . 
i am so big 
i mean my ass is so big 
i ca n't fit in this room i 'm building . 
my ass can barely fit 
through the door of this stanza 
which is why i invented 
seemed to you to want to 
break apart the clouds 
so we left the city , are always 
in the process 
somewhere . some days now 
other times , sitting at the very center 
you will leave your home : 
nothing will hold you . 
you will wear dresses of gold ; skins 
of silver , copper , and bronze . 
the sky above you will shift in meaning 
each time you think you understand . 
of flesh . the shadow of your scales 
will always remain . you will be marked 
you will bathe endlessly in clear streams and fail 
to rid yourself of that scent . 
your feet will never be your own . 
stone will be your path . 
storms will follow in your wake , 
you will desert your children 
kill your lovers and devour their flesh . 
you will love no one 
but the wind and ache of your bones . 
neither will love you in return . 
with age , your hair will grow matted and dull , 
your eyes will cease to shine . 
but nothing will be enough . 
the sea will never take you back . 
the moon 's a little prairie-dog . 
he shivers through the night . 
he sits upon his hill and cries 
for fear that i will bite . 
like every other thing , 
and trembles morning , noon and night 
lest i should spring and sting . 
your dust will be upon the wind 
within some certain years , 
though you be sealed in lead to-day 
amid the country 's tears . 
becomes the heart of town , 
the place to build garage or inn , 
your bones so near to earth , 
how should men know your worth ? 
it says the world is one great grave . 
it tells the folk to live in peace , 
and still , in peace , to die . 
at least , so speaks the moon to me , 
perhaps it is 
a collapse 
perhaps it ca n't 
yet it can cloud 
our blue remains 
so when we fall 
as rain will do , 
nothing fails 
to carry through . 
i was just getting to that . 
but first , old age . 
if you could just let me finish . 
night watch . matching wits we wound up 
alarm & amp ; ran down 
together to silence , 
bide-a-wee 's appointed 
so far from home he did n't know 
a soul . a what ? we heard 
& amp ; fled , his time flew too , 
not one star , not even the half moon 
on the night you were born 
not the flash of salmon 
nor ridges on blue snow 
not the flicker of raven 's 
never-still eye 
not breath frozen in fine hairs 
warming before reaching 
not six minutes more of darkness each day 
not air water food words touch 
not art 
not anything we expect 
not anything we expect to keep 
not anything we expect to keep us alive 
not the center of the sea 
not the compass too close to true north to guide us 
then with no warning 
rise , arc clear of sea water 
places we leave 
slick our bodies 
or foam we feel 
( even somehow taste ) 
but ca n't clearly see . 
we wear its weight 
like atmosphere- 
of what we 've done 
in and with 
each place 
-what to do 
with it now ? - 
and what it does 
to us still . 
i was eating my dinner alone , 
sitting on the living-room couch 
watching a movie on tv for company 
without you to follow me with your 
and your field of study , the energy maggots 
mass with the weight of iron : soft but 
and the chair took revenge on my psyche . 
i was near failing when i managed to utter 
the word `` dove , '' and then you shook me awake . 
`` stop , '' stop fighting with the furniture , you said . 
yet something i could not see pushed hard 
against me , and it was not a force for good . 
of the living was the only way to stop it . 
at the table , at the grave not knowing 
whether to grieve or celebrate , they seemed 
to find a way within the stalled noon clatter 
as the blue heron , looking down , flew farther on . 
nothing dissolved for them the mortal green 
now gone from earth . the flickering they found , 
terror-hope-terror , in fire of sunset clouds 
and day and night . and yet the pleasure they took 
in everything did not wear out . the limestone 
old rains beneath its surface of dusty jet- 
down the prickly cow path to the creek 
making our way along scars 
in the hide of a buffalo whose fur brushed us 
when the wind passed like a tide across the high grasses 
down the prickly cow path to the creek 
in chigger-shade where thoughts of time 
making our way along scars 
lost what they meant up at the house 
when the wind passed like a tide across the high grasses 
in chigger-shade where thoughts of time 
lost what they meant up at the house 
listening to bug-hum and bird-chatter and watching bubbles 
the surface of the water trembling 
once by the creek we found rocks with shells in them 
listening to bug-hum and bird-chatter and watching bubbles 
the surface of the water trembling 
the prairie had been a giant sea he told us 
once by the creek we found rocks with shells in them 
grandma june says everything was sky not sea i said 
none of us sure what we believed 
the prairie had been a giant sea he told us 
grandma june says everything was sky not sea i said 
in the hide of a buffalo whose fur brushed us 
none of us sure what we believed 
how easy , slipping on another man 's 
skin . another country , too , 
its sun 's heat and light 
as insistent as a pair 
his pants , left crumpled 
where the water 
was shallow , he could look 
down and see 
his shadow passing over 
the pale sand , a wobbly twin , 
matching him 
stroke for stroke for stroke . 
of sparrows , and nothing 
is left of the world that is not 
pecked-over , hard and dark 
as the dream of an apple seed . 
the young men laugh 
at an old man drinking 
alone , but here 
are my companions : 
my shadow , as loyal 
and thin as a starved dog , 
and the moon , his whole face 
by then his teeth had rotted out , 
and he often turned to his owner 
with his mouth open as if about 
to speak , a ruined smell 
three days before , 
but his owner dove in and pulled him up 
were long gone . sure , some afternoons 
a kid might walk by 
on the side of the building : the hoop , 
of a man in a top hat , 
the striped ball now like a clot 
with blood , hovering 
over the sleek , dark head . 
let me tell you : death 
is a long silk glove 
dropped to the floor . 
it does n't remember the heft 
of the arm , the fingers 
dancing . 
that limb is gone , and nothing 
will hold its shape again . 
two cars 
race toward the cliff , 
and there is nothing 
you can do . so many lives 
you 've entered 
to your own face , sang 
for the back row . 
but was it your voice ? 
what was that name 
you were born into ? 
what happened to her ? 
was she the one 
another life 
among the enemy people ? 
was it the morning ? 
that she turned into you ? 
a shrine to his memory 
and placed it where 
he passed by every day , but he did not take 
the hint . it was on the ship 
that they seized him . 
but were n't there streets 
in the city that wound forever 
into the minute darkness ? 
were n't there dreams where he met 
himself again and again , 
without ever seeming to wake ? 
kept dividing itself , even as the boat 
in the first years after i disappeared , i read 
every report of drowning : children , 
mostly boys , 
old men whose lungs filled with fluid 
their throats seize up , 
and they die without 
ever swallowing a drop , 
as if they never left the shore . 
some nights i dreamed 
what never happened : i held my drowning 
in my palm like a giant pearl . 
some days , standing behind 
the cash register of my new life , 
of discarded socks . did i ever think 
of the woman i left on the shore 
as i kicked out 
past the last of the breakers ? 
i wo n't say . 
here it was : i might have drowned 
trying to pretend to . i had to swim 
so far out , then mark 
a different beach 
and swim back 
a different man , without knowing 
if his strength was enough 
to carry me to shore . 
there are many kinds of open . 
and lashes . both bent and erect , we are all give 
crack us down to the marrow , and you may find us full 
and lord have mercy ! our hands remember how to turn 
know what women are made of ? open wide and find out . 
nobody sings about alligator eyes anymore , 
bouncing on the ground and rolling 
things have come to eyes 
that gaze in directions we ca n't think of . 
you are told by a judge that nothing new will ever happen . 
you lie to his face 
looking straight into the gaps that want to appear . 
the silhouette of this long stretch of time 
nearly identical computer-generated faces , 
then tiaa-cref . 
can you escape an alligator 
if you run silently and glide into the water ? 
people with happy faces and no luck at all , good or bad , 
jam the signal with a sickle . 
the boy who is kind to animals 
is called wind-chaser 
yesterday he 
gave bread and broken meat 
to the street dogs , his friends 
his friends are catching lizards behind the wall 
with the boy who is kind to animals 
they set fire to a grasshopper , laughing 
along the road 
the children are shaking boxes 
something wants to get out 
the mother spits curses 
she says we should pay because they are hungry 
wind-chaser , eye-of-the-heart , comes-again , 
run away from their baffled eyes 
whatever is we only know 
as in our minds we find it so ; 
no staring fact is half so clear 
no matter how the fact may glow . 
vainly may truth her trumpet blow 
they stick to what they think - wo n't hear 
whatever is . 
stand up - we simply have to go 
and choke each fiction old and dear 
before the modest facts appear ; 
then we may grasp , reluctant , slow , 
whatever is . 
you can say the broken word but can not speak 
for it , can name a precise and particular shade 
of blue if you can remember its name 
( woman of the south , new lilac , second sky ? ) 
as the light , close to blinding , fell-falls 
in bars across a particular page , this 
then another , some other 
followed far too closely by night 
or as the sleeping 
pages recall themselves , one by one , 
in dream-riddled , guarded tones , 
recall themselves from path 
to burnt shore , shore 
to poised wave , dismay 
to present , any present 
of the bewildered and the buried alive 
( we 've been told they were buried alive ) 
is there a door he has n't noticed 
and beyond it a letter which created the door 
or claims it created a door 
which would open either way 
you were a girl of satin and gauze 
now you are my mountain and waterfall companion . 
written in his middle age . 
young as i was they touched me . 
i never thought in my own middle age 
i would have a beautiful young dancer 
to wander with me by falling crystal waters , 
among mountains of snow and granite , 
she would be my very daughter . 
the earth turns towards the sun . 
summer comes to the mountains . 
all the bright long days . 
you put blue jay and flicker feathers 
in your hair . 
two and two violet green swallows 
play over the lake . 
the blue birds have come back 
to nest on the little island . 
the swallows sip water on the wing 
just like the swallows that swirl 
light rain crosses the lake 
hissing faintly . after the rain 
at the edge of the meadow . 
snows of a thousand winters 
melt in the sun of one summer . 
a white crowned night sparrow sings as the moon sets . 
our campfire is a single light 
talk all night . 
wrapped in your down bag 
starlight on your cheeks and eyelids 
your breath comes and goes 
ten thousand birds sing in the sunrise . 
all this will never be again . 
someone is about to come but does n't . is about 
to turn on the stairs but does n't . 
i button my shirt 
like one 's peculiar fate . 
i shut the door , sit quietly . 
the fan begins to whirl 
making a noise bigger than the house . 
someone is about to come and does n't . 
it does n't matter . 
calmly i lean against the wall , 
become a wall . 
my soul of flesh and blood puts a long thread in the needle 's eye . 
i stitch a patch on my son 's umbrella . 
i call one `` elephant '' and another `` lion . '' 
someone is about to come and does n't . is about 
to turn on the stairs and does n't . 
with a will ; for i do not feel tickled . 
it does n't matter . 
i scan their fingers for signs : 
how can i tell you 
baby , oh honey , you 'll 
never know the ride 
blue dotted night along 
poetry rides the wings 
yes , it does 
and it points 
chrome antennae towards 
'burque stations rocking 
brown eyed girls 
bad moon rising 
and i guess 
it also rides 
tuned into new-age radio 
yes , baby 
you and i are two 
kinds of wheels 
on the same road 
listen , listen 
of the tracks we leave 
the wheels on the bus 
go round and round , 
round and round , 
round and round . 
the wheels on the bus 
go round and round , 
all day long . 
swish , swish , swish ... 
the horn on the bus goes 
the people on the bus go 
chat , chat , chat ... 
the children on the bus 
bump up and down ... 
imagine having enough left 
to break a bottle over it . 
listen how pretty , listen 
for glass in nothing nearby 
shattering , just morning birds 
that do not wake whoever 
is not sleeping . come here 
left is the fathers ' last wisdom , soaked wreckage on silver : 
when black men drown , their daughters turn to their mothers 
left shoulder ? how should i dress in public ? they are weary 
to make out their own fathers among the thousands bobbing 
moans and comfort food of meat and cream , the daughters 
try on other names that sound oddly broken when pressed 
forward in mind , they walk using the hip of only one parent . 
they scratch in their sleep . black water wells up in the wound . 
of a little girl , used to be enough to light a daddy 's way home . 
when black men drown , their daughters drag the water 's floor 
with rotting nets , pull in whatever still breathes . they insist their 
dry . parched , they scrub flooded hollows and weep for water 
to give them name and measure as mere blood once did . knocking 
out love in reverse and stumble toward the banks of some river . 
when black men drown their daughters , the rash act is the only 
it never will , and the man and his child and the daughter and her 
father gaze calmly into the wrecked science of each other 's lives . 
when i am asked 
how i began writing poems , 
i talk about the indifference of nature . 
it was soon after my mother died , 
a brilliant june day , 
everything blooming . 
i sat on a gray stone bench 
but the day lilies were as deaf 
as the ears of drunken sleepers 
and the roses curved inward . 
nothing was black or broken 
and not a leaf fell 
for summer holidays . 
i sat on a gray stone bench 
and placed my grief 
in the mouth of language , 
the only thing that would grieve with me . 
when i am dead , my dearest , 
sing no sad songs for me ; 
plant thou no roses at my head , 
nor shady cypress tree : 
be the green grass above me 
and if thou wilt , remember , 
and if thou wilt , forget . 
i shall not see the shadows , 
i shall not feel the rain ; 
i shall not hear the nightingale 
sing on , as if in pain : 
and dreaming through the twilight 
that doth not rise nor set , 
when i am gone what will you do ? 
who will write and draw for you ? 
someone smarter-someone new ? 
someone better-maybe you ! 
that up there no one murders now for gain 
lifted his hand , now tied to hers by chains 
so no one steals , if there 's no property ? 
i shook my head . and as their hands just touched 
he saw it too and cried , she has n't once 
them tight were of no weight or consequence . 
translated from the german 
when i saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light , 
and when i thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming , o then i was happy , 
and the next came with equal joy , and with the next at evening came my friend , 
and that night while all was still i heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores , 
for the one i love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night , 
and his arm lay lightly around my breast - and that night i was happy . 
till rising and gliding out i wander 'd off by myself , 
in the mystical moist night-air , and from time to time , 
look 'd up in perfect silence at the stars . 
when i spoke the words i am gay 
i had n't known that they would free themselves . 
had no words left of his own . he could only unfurl his 
i kissed the darkness three times , because it stole 
before my mother could . 
she told me that i would never 
survive a new york winter : 
a familiar voice , a voice that told jokes you always 
laughed at in class , and he said : i can 
to beat them down . 
like , not what i fear , because sometimes 
that says my arms should be heavy with the weight 
before his heart beats twice . my two young sons play 
plays in my head , & amp ; for everything i do know , the thing 
i do n't say is that this should not be the brick and mortar 
of poetry , the moment when a black father drives 
his black sons to school & amp ; the thing in the air is the death 
of a black boy that the father can not mention , 
that touches the concrete must belong , at some point , 
because his mind would not accept the narrative 
of your child 's dignity , of his right to life , of his humanity , 
the narrative must invite more than the children bleeding 
on crisp fall days ; & amp ; this is why i hate it all , the people around me , 
the black people who march , the white people who cheer , 
that we erase in this american dance around death , as we 
to see a man die ; there is so much that has to disappear 
about him , even as his face , really and truly reminds me 
of my own , in the last photo i took before heading off 
to a cell , disappears , and all i have stomach for is blood , 
and there is a part of me that wishes that it would go away , 
the memories , & amp ; that i could abandon all talk of making it right 
they see into a grave & amp ; make home the series of cells 
that so many of my brothers already call their tomb . 
when i used to focus on the worries , everybody 
was ahead of me , i was the bottom 
a largely spread squat animal . 
i do n't think it 's cool , i replied . 
oh , said he , after a pause , i should have waited 
for you to ask me . 
the waves came in closer and closer . 
when i fall into the gap of suspicion i am no longer here . 
in this world that has got closed over by houses 
from under the belly . life 's dizzy crown 
of whirling lights , circles this head . pure 
with wonder , hot 
with wonder . the streets become golden . all 
we are in easy understanding . 
scarcely talking , thoughts pass between us . 
it is memory . as i search to find 
this day 's sweet drifting . the fog out to sea , the wind . 
of many was i sought their mistress for to be . 
but i did scorn them all and answered them therefore : 
how many weeping eyes i made to pine in woe , 
how many sighing hearts i have not skill to show , 
i will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more : 
as soon as he had said , such change grew in my breast 
that neither night nor day i could take any rest . 
wherefore i did repent that i had said before : 
it means that there 's a horse not far away . 
when last we parted , thou wert young and fair , 
how beautiful let fond remembrance say ! 
alas ! since then old time has stolen away 
full thirty years , leaving my temples bare.- 
the dream of love and youth ! - now both are grey 
though i have suffered many years of pain 
since then , though i did never think to live 
to hear that voice or see those eyes again , 
as when i loved thee young and fair . 
and finds too late that men betray , 
what art can wash her guilt away ? 
the only art her guilt to cover , 
to hide her shame from every eye , 
arranging itself into an orb of dazzle to avoid 
trailing them , waiting for them to relax . when i hear 
swear words pressed to wax-i ca n't even look him 
in the eye when i ask him to give it a good listen 
with me . but he does , ever patient , and we both get 
a light bless of sweat on , a bright address that still maps 
us to each other after all this time . when i read him 
the lyrics , the pink of my cheeks is like the pink 
the pretend flower will reach out and snatch a butterfly 
from the air . when i say flower i mean how her song 
blooms in the cicada-electric mississippi night . when i say 
pink i mean nectar i mean a long kiss good and sweet . 
when 'midst the gay i meet 
that gentle smile of thine , 
though still on me it turns most sweet , 
i scarce can call it mine : 
but when to me alone 
your secret tears you show , 
oh , then i feel those tears my own , 
and claim them while they flow . 
then still with bright looks bless 
the gay , the cold , the free ; 
give smiles to those who love you less , 
but keep your tears for me . 
can smile in many a beam , 
how bright soe'er it seem . 
but , when some deep-felt ray , 
whose touch is fire , appears , 
oh , then the smile is warm 'd away , 
and , melting , turns to tears . 
then still with bright looks bless 
the gay , the cold , the free ; 
give smiles to those who love you less , 
but keep your tears for me . 
on dim laburnum-blossoms , and morning 's dying star , 
i think of thee ( o mine the more if other eyes be sleeping ! ) , 
while sacred and for ever , some perfect law is keeping 
the late , the early twilight , alone and sweet for me . 
i . 
the empty of stomach 
a stillness 
coffee in a cup 
the surface . 
rooted cedar and sage at my feet . 
this movement is where 
ii . 
when my child creates 
that bursts the perfect form . 
nesting within 
the existence of the form 
that no longer exists . 
is where my mind floats . 
iii . 
it is easy to give form 
especially with english words 
when the body wishes to speak , she will 
reach into the night and pull back the rapture of this growing root 
which has little faith in the other planets of the universe , knowing 
only one , by the bulbs of the feet , their branching of toes . but the feet 
have walked with the bones of their ancestors over long trails 
leaving behind the roots of forests . they walk on the ghosts 
of all that has gone before them , not just plant , but animal , human , 
the bones of even the ones who left their horses to drink at the 
spring running through earth 's mortal body which has much to tell 
about what happened that day . 
when the body wishes to speak from the hands , it tells 
of how it pulled children back from death and remembered every detail , 
washing the children 's bodies , legs , bellies , the delicate lips of the girl , 
the future of my people who brought themselves out of the river 
in a spring freeze . that is only part of the story of hands 
that touched the future . 
this all started so simply , just a body with so much to say , 
one with the hum of her own life in a quiet room , 
one of the root growing , finding a way through stone , 
one not remembering nights with men and guns 
nor the ragged clothing and broken bones of my body . 
i must go back to the hands , the thumb that makes us human , 
but then do n't other creatures use tools and lift what they need , 
intelligent all , like the crows here , one making a cast of earth clay 
for the broken wing of the other , remaining 
until it healed , then broke the clay and flew away together . 
i would do that one day , 
but a human can make no claims 
better than any other , especially without wings , only hands 
that do n't know these lessons . 
still , think of the willows 
made into a fence that began to root and leaf , 
then tore off the wires as they grew . 
a human does throw off bonds if she can , if she tries , if it 's possible , 
and anything that lived on earth where everything that was 
still is . 
is that your house he asked 
this used to be my house i said 
but those are not your people 
so that ca n't be your house 
but it is my house i said 
i had some people maybe a few 
even though those are not your people 
even though they do n't look like you 
i had to live somewhere i said 
this is the house where i lived 
but where are your people he said 
my people live in a different house 
they do n't care to know about me 
if you 're the devil 
why are you asking me questions 
the devil said since the house 
you had to live in is gone 
i thought you 'd be happy 
it sure is a hot day i said 
of course it is said the devil 
why do you think i work in town 
what remained : barren stalks bowing heads 
it is hallelujah time , 
the swallows tracing an arc 
of praise just off our balcony , 
the mountains snow-sparkling 
in gratitude . 
here is our real life - 
a handful of possible peonies 
from the market - 
the life we always intended , 
swallow life threading 
the city air with 
our weaving joy . 
are we this simple , then , 
to sing all day - country songs , 
old hymns , camp tunes ? 
we even believe 
the swallows , keeping time . 
when the very last grief 
i will follow you there 
on the very next train , 
not because i lack strength 
to ponder the end result , 
but maybe you forgot to bring 
we were dreaming on an occupied island at the farthest edge 
of a trembling nation when it went down . 
two towers rose up from the east island of commerce and touched 
the sky . men walked on the moon . oil was sucked dry 
by two brothers . then it went down . swallowed 
by a fire dragon , by oil and fear . 
eaten whole . 
it was coming . 
long and solemn clothes , to see what would happen . 
we saw it 
from the kitchen window over the sink 
as we made coffee , cooked rice and 
potatoes , enough for an army . 
the babies . we saw it , 
through the branches 
the sun and storms from our knees 
as we bathed and washed 
the floors . 
it was by their song and talk we knew when to rise 
when to look out the window 
the magnetic field thrown off by grief . 
we heard it . 
the racket in every corner of the world . as 
the hunger for war rose up in those who would steal to be president 
to be king or emperor , to own the trees , stones , and everything 
else that moved about the earth , inside the earth 
and above it . 
we knew it was coming , tasted the winds who gathered intelligence 
from each leaf and flower , from every mountain , sea 
and desert , from every prayer and song all over this tiny universe 
floating in the skies of infinite 
being . 
and then it was over , this world we had grown to love 
for its sweet grasses , for the many-colored horses 
and fishes , for the shimmering possibilities 
while dreaming . 
but then there were the seeds to plant and the babies 
and began to sing about the light flutter 
the kick beneath the skin of the earth 
we felt there , beneath us 
a warm animal 
a song being born between the legs of her ; 
a poem . 
and doth in highest notes appear 
but when she doth of mourning speak , 
ev'n with her sighs the strings do break . 
and as her lute doth live or die , 
let by her passion , so must i : 
for when of pleasure she doth sing , 
my thoughts enjoy a sudden spring , 
but if she doth of sorrow speak , 
ev'n from my heart the strings do break . 
when you are not surprised , not surprised , 
nor leap in imagination from sunlight into shadow 
or from shadow into sunlight 
when you are no longer surprised 
by the quiet or fury of daybreak 
over the edges of torn trees 
torrents of living and dying flung 
upward and outward inward and downward to space 
or else 
peace peace peace peace 
the wood-thrush speaking his holy holy 
far hidden in the forest of the mind 
while slowly 
and the world 's surface dreams again of night 
as the center dreams of light 
when you are not surprised 
by breath and breath and breath 
the first unconscious morning breath 
the tap of the bird 's beak on the pane 
and do not cry out come again 
blest blest that you are come again 
o light o sound o voice of bird o light 
and memory too o memory blest 
that would not stay , or stay 
when you are not surprised 
by death and death and death 
death of color in the child 's cheek 
on the young mother 's breast 
death of sense of touch of sight 
death of delight 
and the inward death the inward turning night 
for hated self and beloved not-self 
when you are not surprised 
by wheel 's turn or turn of season 
and solar rhyme 
and the tides of space that ring the heart 
while still , while still , the wave of the invisible world 
breaks into consciousness in the mind of god 
and join again in the ceaseless know-nothing 
from which you awoke to the first surprise . 
when you are old and grey and full of sleep , 
and nodding by the fire , take down this book , 
and slowly read , and dream of the soft look 
your eyes had once , and of their shadows deep ; 
how many loved your moments of glad grace , 
and loved your beauty with love false or true , 
but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you , 
and loved the sorrows of your changing face ; 
and bending down beside the glowing bars , 
murmur , a little sadly , how love fled 
and paced upon the mountains overhead 
and hid his face amid a crowd of stars . 
and most especially when you have forgotten sunday- 
when you have forgotten sunday halves in bed , 
looking off down the long street 
to nowhere , 
and nothing-i-have-to-do and i'm-happy-why ? 
and if-monday-never-had-to-come- 
when you have forgotten that , i say , 
and how we finally went in to sunday dinner , 
or chicken and rice 
and salad and rye bread and tea 
and chocolate chip cookies- 
i say , when you have forgotten that , 
that the war would be over before they got to you ; 
and how we finally undressed and whipped out the light and flowed into bed , 
and lay loose-limbed for a moment in the week-end 
then gently folded into each other- 
when you have , i say , forgotten all that , 
then you may tell , 
then i may believe 
you have forgotten me well . 
when you think about it , mostly , a cage is air - 
so what is there 
to be afraid of ? 
to the poet , a nation is one big cage ? 
and is n't the nation mostly filled with air ? 
try to put a cage around your dream . 
the cage escapes the dream . 
i see it streak and stream . 
i would give you more , for all you have given us , for 
and almost bowing , tongue-tied with 
the sight of you the sound , the bouquets saying mother- 
- we would not be here , without your song , your eye . 
from time to time i wear a crown of blood streaked grass . 
mama beat me when i was a child for stealing honey from a honey pot 
it swung from the rafters of the kitchen . 
why i stuffed my mouth with golden stuff , no one could tell . 
they made a port under my collar bone with a plastic tube that runs into a blood vessel . 
they say he knelt on the battle field to stroke the beloved 's shadow . 
on board white people would not come near us 
mama tried to teach me english in a sing song voice . 
so you can swim into your life she said . 
pluck , pluck suck , suck 
duck , duck 
stuck , stuck . 
where does such tenderness come from ? 
these are n't the first curls 
i 've wound around my finger- 
i 've kissed lips darker than yours . 
the sky is washed and dark 
( where does such tenderness come from ? ) 
other eyes have known 
but i 've never heard words like this 
in the night 
( where does such tenderness come from ? ) 
with my head on your chest , rest . 
where does this tenderness come from ? 
and what will i do with it ? young 
stranger , poet , wandering through town , 
you and your eyelashes-longer than anyone 's . 
the bones creak like bamboo in wind , 
and strain toward a better life outside the body , 
the life anything has that is n't human . 
feel the chair under you ? what does it want ? 
it wo n't shift an inch . it wo n't ache to touch . 
or glare too long at what bubbles their clothes . 
keep me from the beach when the hot wind blows . 
lock me up where i 'll feel like wood , 
where my bones will shut up , where i 'll be good .

it fears that mute chair

i doubt i 'm standing here ; 
there ca n't be room for me 
and total emptiness .

his mother begged , no , no , no , wild thing . 
max reminded her who bought

where , oh where , do the wild things 
max kept his head down . laughed 
because i go 
to the altar 
i am saved 
despite your 
and fires 
then breaks 
the free-form 
to make 
me whole 
i accept 
of you 
and wear them 
as i would 
( how can you 
know that i 
have bled 
the way 
and back 
biting the dust 
to wear 
your name ? ) 
. . . the wound lies 
but in my 
the house where they lived 
and fought and tried again : 
the air of the place , 
chair with its back to me . 
on the tv set , the christmas cactus 
has bloomed , has spilled its pink flowers 
and died , drying into paper . 
at the round oak table , 
ghosts lean toward one another , 
almost a bow , before rising , 
where , lord , will i find you : 
and where 
wo n't i find you : 
your glory fills the world . 
you dwell deep within- 
you 've fixed the ends of creation . 
you stand , a tower for the near , 
refuge to those far off . 
you 've lain above the ark , here , 
yet live in the highest heavens . 
exalted among your hosts , 
although beyond their hymns- 
no heavenly sphere 
could ever contain you , 
let alone a chamber within . 
in being borne above them 
on an exalted throne , 
you are closer to them 
than their breath and skin . 
their mouths bear witness for them , 
that you alone gave them form . 
your kingdom 's burden is theirs ; 
who would n't fear you ? 
and who could fail 
to search for you- 
who sends down food when it is due ? 
with all my heart i called you . 
and in my going out to meet you , 
i found you coming toward me , 
as in the wonders of your might 
and holy works i saw you . 
who would say he has n't seen 
your glory as the heavens ' 
their awe of you 
without a sound being heard ? 
but could the lord , in truth , 
dwell in men on earth ? 
how would men you made 
from the dust and clay 
fathom your presence there , 
the creatures hovering over 
the world praise your wonders- 
your throne borne high 
above their heads , 
as you bear all forever . 
not long after you had told me , gently , 
that you still grieved for your last love , 
though that had ended almost a year before , 
and that you could have no intimate relationship 
with me , maybe not with anyone for a time , 
i stopped my fork in the air with whatever hung 
on the end of it that i was eating . 
my throat would n't swallow . 
i felt weak and sick , as if it were myself 
the hopes that i had put in your lovely face . 
it was the old story coming true for me once more , 
though you were hardly mine . . . . 
when we finished i walked you back to your car ; 
i do n't remember having much to say . 
why would i ? buildings drifted by , 
and cars , and faces . then we arrived at the place 
where , afterwards , i would never see you again , 
at a parking lot near times square . 
there i marked the sidewalk with x 's 
visible only to me : `` at this place 
i was lost again , '' they 'd say to me 
when i walked there in the future . 
`` dig here and find what 's left of me , 
or what i left behind , where x marks the spot . '' 
i felt like the death's-head and crossed bones 
i only felt a little like gold coins and jewels . 
in my own apartments . and there we stood , 
that could not hold you to me . but x 's 
mean kisses , i realized , as well as 
what is lost : all the kisses i could n't give you 
after all , you yourself had been marked 
by loss , even in your laughter that afternoon 
at the show i had taken you to . bright-eyed 
and smiling in the seat beside me , you 
stole my glances with your dark , dark eyes 
and your long hair . i thought that i had not been 
this happy in a long time with a woman 
and was ready to become even more happy , 
ready to do anything that you wanted 
in order to please you , to see that smile come up , 
not knowing what you were soon to say to me 
i felt life fall away from me . again i felt 
that i would never be happy . i felt the words 
that i had wanted to say to you leaving me , rushing 
out of my chest like dead air , until i had no more words 
to say . i seemed to cut and swallow my food 
as if it were me myself that stuck in pieces 
on the end of the fork i had raised to my mouth . 
had i been chewing on my own flesh ? 
on all that was dark and hopeless in myself , 
i stood beside you in the lot where you 
had parked your car , with the x 's buzzing 
in the air , sticking themselves to you 
when you reached out to embrace me , i 
moved to embrace you in return-and then came 
the part that i do n't want to remember , 
the part i hate : i caught a glimpse of your 
face as we put our arms around each other , 
and your face said everything to me about 
how you had wasted the afternoon , how eager 
of disgust and relief that the thing would soon 
be over , that i would be crossed out forever 
from your life-and everything that i hated 
about myself , my stupid chin , my ugly nose , 
my wreck of a heart , crashed over me , 
that i have only ever let myself feel 
a little bit at a time , though it is always there 
he 's as high as a georgia pine , my father 'd say , half laughing . southern trees 
as measure , metaphor . highways lined with kudzu-covered southern trees . 
open on sturdy branches of skin-smooth bark : my favorite southern trees . 
dark , beneath live oaks . southern heat makes us grateful for southern trees . 
plastic leaves , amazed how little a northern girl knows about southern trees . 
i 've never forgotten the charred bitter fruit of holiday 's poplars , nor will i : 
what hand opened the door , i do n't know . no one 
lives there in winter . and i do n't know if it was for entrance 
or for exit that the place opened itself , or was opened , 
though i do know what boundaries 
were broken . the lake lay frozen , the sky 
still as folded wings . and everywhere snow 
blown into the rooms , strewn across the braided rugs 
like a slow cold tide , white and silent , out of its element 
with greed . then i remembered the photograph , 
black and white , as old as me or older . what eye 
though i do know that boundaries were broken : 
a woman , her grey dress blowing toward land , 
lost on the shore in the dim light of her long day 's end , 
and a man , farther up the beach , alone . the sea- 
and the stolen child it drank up when each 
entered the other in a moment 
against the winds of loss . the woman , the man , 
their child gone-slipped from the safe home of their love , 
swallowed whole . i am not going to try to feel 
what that woman felt , or to speak with her voice . i do n't know 
what she did next or how she did what she did next . 
she is the mother , my fear , all the love ever lost to grief . 
i am sure that time drifted past her , with her , within her . 
i know that that summer , like all summers , moved on 
through the fall into winter , that the shore closed up , 
abandoned , cold . and that the thing lost 
still blows through us , the swollen door no longer shuts . 
a fallen hem . it is far too expensive for me , 
in that year , someone drew a blade 
through a bolt of fabric and stitched 
this coat into being . i carry it 
to the dressing room , slip my arms in . 
silk lining spills against my skin . i clasp the belt 
where blood stirs and melts . in glass , 
i am wrapped in the weight of old red : 
red pinched into girl cheeks 
and smeared from torn knees , 
bitten lips , a rough kiss , 
all the red bled into pads and rags , 
the weight of red , the wait for red , that we share . 
this pocket may once have sheltered something 
precious - a necklace , a love letter , or 
a fresh egg , feather-warm , its shell brittle 
so it could n't crack , could n't leak through seams , 
so it could n't stain the dress within . 
i spent a night turning in bed , 
my love was a feather , a flat 
sleeping thing . she was 
very white 
and quiet , and above us on 
the roof , there was another woman i 
also loved , had 
a fit she 
returned . that 
lonely , i yelled , 
she said , beside me , she put 
her hand on 
my back , for which act 
i think to say this 
from a ways , the sky and your hands 
come to my eyes , from some distant part of you ; 
it 's snowing out , you 're all in the white of the snow 
and the field beyond the window is a body 
that 's where it returns , in a word translated into silence 
where the sparrows tie loose knots 
your palms on your eyes , chest on your knees 
forehead in the snow . 
translated from the italian 
as the meat 
within the shell 
a bleached weed 
a fig 
dusted to sweet the skin 
held to the ivory of oxen hoof 
the space 
between sins i am 
as i am so 
the host on the tongue 
god of bread 
the salt of lot 
as god is 
a crown of thorn 
so am i the echo 
while the black oak 
whistling ? yellow 
birch and red pine . 
might for now define , 
but soon the whole 
church is chanting 
at the same time , 
flame splashing 
bright from the dirty 
bucket of the earthly , 
roaring likeness 
and only likeness 
cool of the night . . . 
having been blown away 
by a book 
i am in the gutter 
at the end of the street 
in little pieces 
like the alphabet 
( mother do not worry 
letters are not flesh 
though there 's meaning in them 
but not when they are mean 
my letters to you were mean 
i found them after you died 
and read them and tore them up 
and fed them to the wind 
i love you now leave ) 
also at the end of the street 
there is a magnolia tree 
the white kind 
after it blooms 
so the tree winds up 
in the street 
our naked shivering bodies 
must be at some distance 
missing us come back 
come back they cry 
come home 
put down that book 
whenever you read 
you like your parrot 
more than you like me 
and stuff like that 
( dear father 
you always were a bore 
but i loved you more 
than interesting things 
and in your honor 
i 've felt the same about myself 
and everyone i 've ever met ) 
i like to read in tree houses 
whenever i can which is seldom 
and sometimes never 
the book that blew me away 
held all the problems 
of the world 
and those of being alive 
under my nose 
but i felt far away from them 
at the same time 
reading is like that 
( i am sorry i did not 
go to your funeral 
but like you said 
on the phone 
an insect can not crawl 
to china ) 
here at the end of the street 
the insects go on living 
under the dome 
of the pacific sky 
if mary and joseph 
had walked the sixty miles 
they would have found 
themselves floating 
in the outer pitch of space 
it would have been cold 
a long night 
in the dark endless 
and when they began to cry 
the whole world would think 
something had just been born 
i like to read into things 
as i am continually borne forward 
in time by the winds like the snow 
( dear sister 
you were perfect in every way 
like a baby 
please tell brother 
the only reason 
we never spoke 
was out of our great love 
for each other 
which made a big wind 
that blew us apart ) 
i think i am coming back 
i feel shoulders 
where a parrot could land 
though a tree would be 
as good a place as any 
you can not teach a tree to talk 
trees can say it is spring 
but not though bright sunlight 
can also be very sad 
have you noticed ? 
first snow-i release her into it- 
i know , released , she wo n't come back . 
this is different from letting what , 
already , we count as lost go . it is nothing 
like that . also , it is not like wanting to learn what 
losing a thing we love feels like . oh yes : 
i love her . 
released , she seems for a moment as if 
some part of me that , almost , 
i would n't mind 
understanding better , is that 
not love ? she seems a part of me , 
and then she seems entirely like what she is : 
a white dog , 
less white suddenly , against the snow , 
who wo n't come back . i know that ; and , knowing it , 
i release her . it 's as if i release her 
because i know . 
in winter 
all the singing is in 
the tops of the trees 
where the wind-bird 
with its white eyes 
among the branches . 
like any of us 
he wants to go to sleep , 
but he 's restless- 
he has an idea , 
from under his beating wings 
as long as he stays awake . 
but his big , round music , after all , 
so , it 's over . 
in the pine-crown 
he makes his nest , 
he 's done all he can . 
i do n't know the name of this bird , 
i only imagine his glittering beak 
tucked in a white wing 
while the clouds- 
which he has summoned 
from the north- 
which he has taught 
to be mild , and silent- 
into the world below 
like stars , or the feathers 
of some unimaginable bird 
that loves us , 
that is asleep now , and silent- 
that has turned itself 
into snow . 
more than the black 
which it displaces- 
upon any fine day 
i jump these traces 
the tumbled skirts upon a chair , 
the novel flung half-open , where 
the mirror that has sucked your face 
forgotten memories of grace ; 
and you half dressed and half awake , 
your slant eyes strangely watching me , 
with eyes that , having slept not , ache ; 
this ( need one dread ? nay , dare one hope ? ) 
will rise , a ghost of memory , if 
ever again my handkerchief 
he knows how to do what he sets out to do 
even from a distance , the less said the better . the colors in some of these landscapes 
are perfectly desperate . 
in a portrait there is never anything wrong 
with the mouth . there is never anything wrong 
the next best things are certain . heaven 
knowing the next best things . the young 
can explain it , but who would they explain 
it to ? more promise than performance 
next to a beautiful woman . it is possible 
the timid portion of the population 
unless held firmly in check will imitate 
on the exchange . she wanted something 
mysterious , as if everything were the same . 
to look at him and the thing he can never look at 
i took my courage , which starts everywhere and goes 
nowhere , and spoke to her . here 
from the outside . 
seem to have the enemy at their mercy . 
it can be argued that christ himself spoke 
to the mob . the crowd will stop 
to see almost anything . the crowd will stop 
to see something about almost everything . 
a white hunter is nearly crazy . 
the lies i could tell , 
when i was growing up 
light-bright , near-white , 
high-yellow , red-boned 
in a black place , 
were just white lies . 
i could easily tell the white folks 
not in that pink and green 
shanty-fled shotgun section 
along the tracks . i could act 
came straight out the window 
keep quiet , quiet as kept , 
like the time a white girl said 
( squeezing my hand ) , now 
we have three of us in this class . 
but i paid for it every time 
mama found out . 
she laid her hands on me , 
then washed out my mouth 
with ivory soap.this 
and cleanse your lying tongue . 
thinking they 'd work 
from the inside out . 
the white of your skin , for skin , except 
sleeping within it-a hint of red maple leaf , 
a touch of the blue ice at the edge of a melting 
that lies within and makes the skin shed , not 
like a snake , but as a tree ( one of those golden 
of the river ) that sheds its leaves each moment 
while an eternity of leaf remains . oh , nothing 
seems to me as white as your skin , all your languid 
ease of being-one resting upon the other , 
the sliver of your shoulder against the black 
fabric-reminds me so of the lost realm of beauty 
that i am afraid of nothing , and only dazed 
whales came swimming toward me-how white 
they were , slipping out of the darkness , radiant 
as white fire , gliding through the weight of water , 
and when they sang in that chamber as small 
of what they had consumed , i was almost in love 
with them ; they seemed the lost children 
like the wings of birds or angels , clicking and whistling 
in their bodies , like clouds drifting through 
so i did not think of you so much as i felt you 
drifting through my being , in some gesture 
that held me poised like a hummingbird above 
the scarlet blossoms of the trumpet vine , i kissed you 
above the heart , and by above i mean there , 
that so many use to divide the body in half and so mistake 
for the place where the heart lies , but the exact 
location , a little to the left , just on the crescent 
where the breast begins to rise ; oh , i know 
the disappearing room , that landscape of the skin 
and night that opens in imagination and in feeling 
upon a sea of snow , so that just one kiss above 
the heart is a kiss upon the heart , as if one could 
kiss the very pulse of being , light upon the head 
angels were once believed to dance , and all that 
nakedness without could not have been 
except for all that burning deep within 
a man walks beside them 
with a whip that he cracks . 
the cart they draw is painted 
fierce eyes and ranks of spears . 
they are on the steep road 
that goes up the mountain . 
their neat-stepping hoofs 
appear to be flickering 
in the sun , raising dust . 
they are higher than the roofs 
lie ripening . they move 
among the dark green olives 
that grow on the rocks . 
vanish around a corner 
the region of mist and darkness . 
i think i can see them still : 
the color of ivory 
in the gathering dusk . 
because my father said yes 
my mother said i know my daughter 
would never 
to marry . 
although my father although 
my mother although we rarely 
although we whispered 
although the silence although 
the absence although even now 
some tv books not to mention 
groups raging against our socialist- 
communist-fascist although but still : 
mostly our college literature 
to mention our young president 
who could scarcely have been 
imagined when we when i- 
and although i 've gone back 
i 'm still learning this un- 
the knot of yes but re- 
writing this yes yes 
the republic lies in the blossoms of washington . 
white petals 
drop into the dark river . 
they ride out to the sea like stars . 
i travel to a planet 
where there are no plants or animals . 
everyone lives in harmony . 
i do n't want to go home . 
both at the same time . 
i build my house with my own hands , 
and it 's beautiful , 
with simple , perfect lines . 
i 'm the farmer waiting for the vegetables 
to grow , so i can eat . 
i 'm the hunter aiming at the bear . 
i do n't want to shoot it , but my family needs meat . 
the bear gives me a long dumb animal look . 
we 'll use his skin for blankets , 
his fat to light our lamps . 
our cabin will stink all night . 
i 'm the man on the steps of the house 
where the president 's widow lives . 
all night i wait for the stranger 
to get out of his car 
so i can flash my look of recognition . 
i 'm the man who loves dogs . 
i 'm the black man . 
i close my eyes 
and it gets dark inside . 
i feel the sun on my face . 
i see the light through my eyelids . 
it 's bright , intelligent 
free of all cares . 
i 'm the heir of a great american family . 
unexpected tragedy is all that can stop me . 
i wrap the blue towel 
after washing , 
around the damp 
as a sleeping cat , 
and sit out on the porch . 
still dripping water , 
it 'll be dry by supper , 
by the time the dust 
settles off your shoes , 
though it 's only five 
past noon . think 
of the luxury : how to use 
the afternoon like the stretch 
of lawn spread before me . 
there 's the laundry , 
sun-warm clothes at twilight , 
and the mountain of beans 
in my lap . each one , 
i 'll break and snap 
the small buttons 
of my cotton blouse 
are pulling away from my body . 
i feel the strain of threads , 
heavy as a flock of birds 
in the tree . already , 
the orange sponge cake 
is rising in the oven . 
i know you 'll say it makes 
your mouth dry 
and i 'll watch you 
drench your slice of it 
and lick the plate clean . 
so much hair , my mother 
the thick braided rope 
in her hands while we washed 
my mind often elsewhere 
as we did the morning chores together . 
sometimes , a few strands 
would catch in her gold ring . 
i worked hard then , 
when i would let the rope down 
at night , strips of sheets , 
knotted and tied , 
while she slept in tight blankets . 
my hair , freshly washed 
like a measure of wealth , 
you would wait for the signal , 
for the movement of curtains 
from the shadow of moths . 
cloth , hair and hands , 
you gave me a white rose 
put the lamp on the stove 
it caught fire 
thunder above the lake 
blue flash 
you see 
the whole experience 
is electric 
how can he love me and hate what i am ? 
gold , like butter and eggs.my god , i prayed 
and likeness of him . nearby , a handsome 
priest looked at me like a stone ; i looked back , 
the white spine waved to me from his white throne . 
being in a place not my own , much less 
myself , i climbed out , a beast in a crib . 
reason , not faith , would change him . 
the white train emerges from a dark curtain 
of tall fir trees with its coat of light snow . 
the white train appears as though newly escaped 
out of the forest into the clear white 
meadow , melting the fresh snow around it . 
over there the folded arms of soldiers who 
gather in small groups . we can not see 
on their way to the revolution perhaps . 
in the dining car , behind the velvet curtains- 
and small marrow . already today 
fog the windows with their warm breath 
order everyone off the train , into the new snow . 
it was the village idiot who played 
his chess without the fool , the bowl 
of soup who said too late , too late , too late 
to blame the thread , the spoon , the text , the mole . 
silence of everyone i ever loved 
this cloudy friday evening 
spring but still cold 
who 's that 
swaddled in 
the uneasy atmosphere 
in silence 
no chatter or pleasant surprise 
with the beloved 
who 's that 
sprouting now out of 
who is it straining 
to pop out 
of the hardwood 
rings of time 
into the cool air 
like there 's another cool world 
on the other side of this one 
worth pushing 
through to or maybe 
we 're already there 
is that 
why we shake 
my head knocks against the stars . 
my finger-tips are in the valleys and shores of universal life . 
i have been to hell and back many times . 
i know all about heaven , for i have talked with god . 
who has seen the wind ? 
neither i nor you : 
but when the leaves hang trembling , 
the wind is passing through . 
who has seen the wind ? 
neither you nor i : 
but when the trees bow down their heads , 
the wind is passing by . 
who kills my history knows 
it is buried 
in the same air ay breathe . 
only a hair is needed to keep you , mother . 
only a fit of bone . 
comfort , comfort , ay am my own . 
wanting simple , a sun like water , a flow and stir of air . 
warm stone , black-warm , dirt scent and bird . 
ay am put out to weather . 
animal eyed me here-heaving , breathing over- 
then left . comfort , comfort me . 
high-ay am my own weight carried by , 
kind horse , kind mother , gone . 
when they ate , they ate straight 
nights , slate olives , he could n't see . 
they turn the water off , so i live without water , 
they paint the windows black , so i live without sunshine , 
they lock my cage , so i live without going anywhere , 
they take each last tear i have , i live without tears , 
they take my heart and rip it open , i live without heart , 
they take my life and crush it , so i live without a future , 
they stop up each hope , so i have no passage out of hell , 
they give me pain , so i live with pain , 
they give me hate , so i live with my hate , 
they have changed me , and i am not the same man , 
they give me no shower , so i live with my smell , 
they separate me from my brothers , so i live without brothers , 
who understands me when i say this is beautiful ? 
i can not fly or make something appear in my hand , 
i can not make the heavens open or the earth tremble , 
i can live with myself , and i am amazed at myself , my love , 
my beauty , 
i am stubborn and childish , 
i practice being myself , 
and i have found parts of myself never dreamed of by me , 
when the walls were built higher , 
when the water was turned off and the windows painted black . 
i followed these signs 
followed the blood-spotted path , 
deeper into dangerous regions , and found so many parts of myself , 
who taught me water is not everything , 
and gave me new eyes to see through walls , 
and when they spoke , sunlight came out of their mouths , 
and i was laughing at me with them , 
who understands me when i say this is beautiful ? 
whoever you are holding me now in hand , 
without one thing all will be useless , 
i give you fair warning before you attempt me further , 
i am not what you supposed , but far different . 
put me down and depart on your way . 
or else by stealth in some wood for trial , 
or back of a rock in the open air , 
( for in any roof 'd room of a house i emerge not , nor in company , 
or possibly with you sailing at sea , or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island , 
here to put your lips upon mine i permit you , 
with the comrade 's long-dwelling kiss or the new husband 's kiss , 
for i am the new husband and i am the comrade . 
where i may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip , 
carry me when you go forth over land or sea ; 
for thus merely touching you is enough , is best , 
and thus touching you would i silently sleep and be carried eternally . 
for these leaves and me you will not understand , 
already you see i have escaped from you . 
for it is not for what i have put into it that i have written this book , 
nor will my poems do good only , they will do just as much evil , perhaps more , 
therefore release me and depart on your way . 
i 'm back on plan for good this time . 
the kind you hope to hide 
with body spray . but it gets worse 
whipped to weeping . now i land my balloon 
for the specific kind of ugly 
salad oil is . happy date night , darling . 
balloon , darling . only kindness is specific . 
whose voice to have called you 
and brought you to breathing 
enclosed in career ? 
whose thoughts are n't like your thoughts 
but strips of bright 
on dead twisting paths 
till words could n't keep you 
collected in hours 
confused with the grass 
to show us by falling 
more reasons for leaving 
thought 's office to leave you 
asleep without fear 
is n't the moon dark too , 
most of the time ? 
and does n't the white page 
seem unfinished 
without the dark stain 
he did n't banish darkness . 
instead he invented 
and that small mole 
or did you mean to ask 
`` why are you sad so often ? '' 
ask the moon . 
ask what it has witnessed . 
why art thou silent ! is thy love a plant 
yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant- 
for nought but what thy happiness could spare . 
speak- though this soft warm heart , once free to hold 
a thousand tender pleasures , thine and mine , 
be left more desolate , more dreary cold 
than a forsaken bird's-nest filled with snow 
is a mystery even now . 
for if a man should have been content 
it was him ; two acres of barley , 
he was last seen going out to plough 
on a march morning , bright and early . 
they had found all abandoned , with 
horses , like man and wife , 
shifting their weight from foot to 
foot , and gazing into the future . 
i 'll tell you , if you really want to know : 
remember that day you lost two years ago 
with all those stones you 'd stolen from the shore ? 
most of them went dark and nothing more , 
but sometimes one would blink the secret color 
it had locked up somewhere in its stony sleep . 
this is how you knew the ones to keep . 
so i collect the dull things of the day 
in which i see some possibility 
but which are dead and which have the surprise 
i do n't know , and i 've no pool to help me tell- 
so i look at them and look at them until 
one thing makes a mirror in my eyes 
then i paint it with the tear to make it bright . 
this is why i sit up through the night . 
for it is theirs by right , though she did n't call it 
the heavenly song of cock and cunt , perhaps that 's 
the inevitable conclusion of the sacred heart wounded 
into a womb , an arrow in the hand of an angel 
piercing such a depth in the body until it 's beyond 
what the body knows , delirious among the lilies 
or tasting the sweet meats of that table . yet 
whoever the mystic woman is , she 's not 'about ' 
sex ; it 's not some sexual fantasy that she lies with 
in the dark mansion of god , sleeping every night 
in a different room , curling herself to the different shapes 
of emptiness . it 's not some narrative of first 
he this , then she that , that makes her tremble , 
being naked and open to nothing but that 
the saint runs out of the house into the hills , 
for she remains , asleep and dreaming , and in god 's 
of love , she lies down with them all in the depths 
feminine body , pouring out of her as if out of the nipple 
hand , as she herself becomes her own threshold ; 
no faces remembered or imagined flicker across the hymen 
but the form of herself , the knowing of the body 
the knowing of the body allowed only to men ; 
women , only the known or unknown , as she is known and un- 
known but as she knows herself as she knows the other 
that she is not : she enters herself , with fingers 
of domestic life , with a stalk from the forsaken 
garden , and with the lost wing feather of the angel 
of death and with the voice of a baby 's cry 
once my sister told me that from her summit at the city 
pool she could see the yellow billows spread like gas 
or dreams between kids ' legs . in something the size of the sea , 
you ca n't be sure who 's watching from above . let 's say 
the ocean would make bone of a body , coral of bone . 
piss , and a tiger-fish darts through a skull-hole , a weed 
the bulbs flash from the sea . you , too , have felt 
it breathing down your neck . you eat fish . you 've heard 
joe 's , my happiness as absurd , but i 'm not going to go 
piss in the ocean about it . no , not in the ocean . 
each time we moved to a new apartment , 
and we did three times , i knew 
i should n't , that i should 
leave while i had the chance , but each 
time we moved to a new apartment 
we were desperate , 
and we only had one bed , 
some of whom knew that you fractured 
inches from my head , 
and some of whom were aware 
that you threw things at me 
when i said things 
you did n't like , as if my words were 
things i threw at you first . 
it made sense to you . 
i ca n't remember the bad things 
i said-my self-serving 
you , and why not : i always 
remembered the bad 
things you did . 
and , yes , i do remember 
everything you threw : 
a chair 
aimed at my knees , 
on the shade of our only 
nice lamp , oil stains 
also , you threw 
me against a 
wall , but you always said it was because 
i made you so mad because 
you loved me so much 
and did n't want to lose me 
that you 'd lose control 
instead and later 
beg me to stay , that if i left you 
it meant you would never 
be loved and i could n't 
bear to have you think that 
about either one of us . 
i was n't someone 
who 'd let herself be hit ; i 'd never 
take that from a man . a man 
if he did what you did . 
but you had been 
hurt and all that 
pain and anger needed more 
time , and i made you so 
crazy , i was so 
stubborn and good at mean 
words , what else were you 
supposed to do ? 
you liked to raise your fist pretending 
to hit me and then 
half-smile when 
that you had never actually hit me , 
never punched me 
with a closed fist : you 'd only grabbed me 
and choked me and flung me and made 
meant to miss , never truly 
on the head with something heavy , 
something light , maybe , 
like a book i loved . 
when a woman you love hits you 
on the head with a book 
you love , is that love ? 
i was so ashamed and afraid someone 
would find out about us , then i was 
afraid and ashamed 
people already knew but did n't know 
what to do . did i really think 
this was a secret ? 
not from the cops we called during two bad 
with her rent-free that month 
i kicked you out . you two had a blast . 
but i could n't pay the rent 
on my own , 
so you moved back in , triumphant , 
how much money you 'd saved . 
surrounded by friends , 
whom could i tell ? 
why would i tell anyone who did n't 
already know us well enough 
to already know ? 
if everyone knew , none of us said so . 
we talked , all of us , almost 
so how did we keep ourselves so quiet ? 
you and i , together in this , 
were alone with this , 
alone among women who loved us . 
the two of us never more alone 
than when together . 
i am unjust , but i can strive for justice . 
my life 's unkind , but i can vote for kindness . 
i , that am blind , cry out against my blindness . 
fighting mankind , to win sweet luxury . 
so he will be , though law be clear as crystal , 
tho ' all men plan to live in harmony . 
come , let us vote against our human nature , 
every morning 
i look for you 
on the menu . 
where are 
your eyes and lips , 
my side order of thighs ? 
i 'm so hungry for the 
sauce of you and the 
way your blouse opens 
like a flame . 
a good problem to have . we is throats 
knees and cracked elbows . we is ham 
have a problem 
the morning that the world began 
and i suspect the lion might 
( if he 'd been closer ) have tried a bite . 
i think that 's as it ought to be 
and not as it was taught to me . 
i think the lion has a right 
and if the lion bothered adam , 
the way to treat a lion right 
true , the lion is better fit 
for biting than for being bit . 
but if you look him in the eye 
you 'll find the lion 's rather shy . 
he really wants someone to pet him . 
the trouble is : his teeth wo n't let him . 
he has a heart of gold beneath 
but the lion just ca n't trust his teeth . 
it 's about to rain , suddenly 
and without mercy . 
the rain will be brief , i can tell . 
of those anxious sounds bent 
-perhaps i will even see the pile of bills . 
the rain will be brief , but no matter-i wo n't 
get back outside tonight . 
so , i have maybe ten minutes 
for this to get said 
before all is wet and after the fact 
of chances , 
most missed . 
that makes the mist that keeps 
in her crib , jumping now , 
her sleep a bad joke . 
ten years since last i was alone . 
my mind is not my own . 
reading the new poems tonight of my old teacher 
-she was never taken with me , not 
of childhood 
through art . 
it is as serious as childhood , 
which we all pursue to the end . 
and yet , if her poems-ornate as stained glass 
leaning against a wall in the glass shop , windows 
looking in on almost 
nothing-say anything , 
it is , i am alone ; beauty is everything 
except company , so beauty is nothing , almost . 
does she want what i have ? do i ? my poems 
lie . 
the rain is coming . a few drops more and i 'll lose 
how tense it makes me , reading 
how only some of the words 
resolve under my eyes 
into sentences 
like a note inscribed on a greeting card 
by an aunt who never knew me well . 
what i mean is the job is never 
done , i 'm never through . and i 'm not made 
for tasks that linger ; some 
of me is always considering 
all the money i owe 
and the kid 
who kindly bought 
because my dad forgot to send me to school 
with a couple of bucks . 
which is of course to say 
reading poetry is a metaphor . 
nothing ever 
so why did i choose poetry ? 
how the line breaks before 
the thought is done , how the line , 
a partial thing , 
is the measure , 
and it 's never enough . my 
college love 
never did come running back 
after i sent her 
and my lamentation 
did not un-injure my son or 
get me back my job . 
i woke up panting and confused 
from the same nightmare over and over 
through childhood-i ca n't remember when 
it stopped : my task was to build 
with colored blocks atop 
a floating green 
island a kind of little city ; 
this was urgent-there would be no 
forgiveness if it was not complete . 
the dream ended 
with me standing before 
as it hovered away , 
my job still undone , and i was 
dropped back into my bed to 
beg my mother 
for something she could 
understand but not give . 
it 's hard now not to see it as 
for her dying only a few years 
later , her life , my life 
like all lives , unfinished . 
and so i came to poetry . 
and then i thought , can i have more 
of this , would it be possible 
for every day to be a greater awakening : more light , 
more light , your face on the pillow 
from paint and sheet rock it feels 
before he hauled me up and forward , 
of all that blood just under the skin 
and in the long , thick muscle of the neck- 
i went to school with . he knew 
how to stand with just the crescent 
of his hoof along a boot toe and press , 
sudden twisting of his leg until the hoof 
pinned one 's foot completely to the ground , 
we 'd have to beat and beat him with a brush 
to push him off , that hot 
deliberately on us , to watch- 
like us , he knew how to announce through violence 
how he did n't hunger , did n't want 
with this cunning : this thing 
that was and was not human we must respect 
for itself and not our imagination of it : i loved him because 
i could not love him anymore 
in the ways i 'd taught myself , 
as if they were one body , one fluid motion 
of electric understanding i would never feel 
working its way through fingers to the bit : this thing 
an indifference that gave me 
logic and a measure : i too might stop wanting 
the hand placed on back or shoulder 
and never feel the desired response . 
i loved the horse for the pain it could imagine 
what was not slave or instinct , that when you turn to me 
it is a choice , it is always a choice to imagine pleasure 
bleeding into another as the future 
bleeds into the past , more light , more light , 
your hand against my shoulder , the image 
is the first right of being alive . 
quietly unfamiliar . `` it does n't have to be great , '' 
in his or her voice , `` just so long as it has 
its own special character . '' 
then the deft and lovely hand of the holy ghost lit 
on a slim volume of poetry- 
it was your book . 
it was your book . 
the first poem caused the holy ghost to frown ; 
ah , but not with disdain , rather with curiosity ! 
maybe it happened after your death , but so what ? it 
happened . 
`` i 'm taking this back to my perfect desk , '' 
because we rage inside 
the old boundaries , 
like a young girl leaving the church , 
scared of her parents . 
because we all dream of saving 
like the locked antlers of moose 
who die on their knees in pairs . 
you ca n't argue beauty 's not an accident , the particular heft and angle 
it fades , we say , something about years and sun , the nights we slept 
there were whole years when i was a girl . but now , these ladies 
the magic settles uneasy ; it turns out fairy dust was always 
it 's artificial earth . they ca n't quite make themselves care . 
we 'll waste it , they know , whatever we 've been given . 
comes the time when it 's later 
puts the bill , and very soon after 
rings out the sound of lively laughter- 
picking up change , hands like a walrus , 
and a head without any apparent size , 
nothing but two eyes- 
so that 's you , man , 
or me . i make it as i can , 
i pick up , i go 
faster than they know- 
out the door , the street like a night , 
any night , and no one in sight , 
but then , well , there she is , 
old friend liz- 
and she opens the door of her cadillac , 
i step in back , 
and we 're gone . 
she turns me on- 
there are very huge stars , man , in the sky , 
and from somewhere very far off someone hands me a slice of apple pie , 
and i eat it- 
slowly . and while certainly 
they are laughing at me , and all around me is racket 
of these cats not making it , i make it 
that has everybody talking ? 
cutting through 
each of us , like a sword 
through wet bamboo ; it 's a graceful 
breaks , and then a darkening 
sky rolls over the lake , and then 
to make her understand , 
to allow her to share in our delights ! 
you may store your lunch 
remember to empty yourself , 
of the lake behind you 
to remind you of the lake 
behind you . do n't listen to those of us 
who are certain 
of the small death 
intent , intent signals purpose , 
yellow . paper cuts will happen . band-aids 
are in the top left drawer 
in the kitchen , 
next to the cake-cutting knife 
i live a life of appetite and , yes , that 's right , 
i live a life of privilege in new york , 
say that again ? 
i have a rule- 
i woke up this morning in my air-conditioning . 
at the end of my legs were my feet . 
my feet were there on the far side of my legs . 
i do n't really think i am going to . 
i do n't think i 'm going to . 
i can see out the window it is n't raining . 
is it true about the poor ? 
i saw a rat down in the subway . 
so what if you saw a rat . 
they make me shy . 
i keep my distance . 
i 'm getting to the bottom of the island . 
lower broadway comes to a boil and city hall is boiling . 
i 'm half asleep but i 'm awake . 
at the other end of me are my feet 
walking down broadway in the heat . 
i 'm half asleep in the heat . 
i 'm , so to speak , wearing a hat . 
i 'm no saint francis . 
when i look in a mirror , 
there 's an old man in a trance . 
you see what happens if you do n't make sense ? 
it only makes sense to not . 
you feel the flicker of a hummingbird 
it takes a second to find . 
it 's here . it 's there . it hovers , begging , hand out . 
and i pity you still at the loom of life , 
if you reach the day of hate , of terrible truth . 
for the cloth of life is woven , you know , 
to a pattern hidden under the loom i 
a pattern you never see ! 
and you weave high-hearted , singing , singing , 
you guard the threads of love and friendship 
for noble figures in gold and purple . 
and long after other eyes can see 
you have woven a moon-white strip of cloth , 
you laugh in your strength , for hope o'erlays it 
with shapes of love and beauty . 
the loom stops short ! the pattern 's out ! 
you 're alone in the room ! you have woven a shroud ! 
and hate of it lays you in it ! 
she took such good care of him 
that he seldom lifted a finger . 
so only now does he stand 
by the sink and peel 
he notes , fits the human hand , 
was made to do so , one 
of the miracles . she knew all along . 
full eighteen weeks had been , 
came smiling o'er the green . 
blithe as a lad of seventeen , 
give me your pail , i 'll carry it 
for you , if you think well . 
you shall not touch , i vow ; 
i 've carried it myself before , 
and i can carry it now . 
so side by side they walked awhile , 
then he at last did say ; 
and see you , if i may . 
you may see me at any time , 
if you look where i be . 
says he , but hear me yet awhile , 
i 've something more to tell ; 
i gladly would a sweetheart be 
kind sir , and if you do , 
another you may seek , for i 
when she had made him this reply , 
he 'd nothing more to say 
what of this house with massive walls 
and small-paned windows , gay with blooms ? 
a quaint and ancient aspect falls 
not this new country 's rush and haste 
could breed , one thinks , so still a life ; 
a placid foe of worldly strife . 
for this roof covers , night and day , 
their light is out , their story told . 
dear household fires that can not die ; 
they wait through separation dark 
an endless union by and by . 
to fit the autumn afternoon , 
the dropping poplar leaves , the dream 
of spring that faded all too soon . 
upon the highest window-ledge 
a glowing scarlet flower shines down . 
the tired-hearted and the lone ! 
what disappointment you have known ! 
they count their little wealth of hope 
and spend their waiting days in peace , 
what comfort their poor loneliness 
must find in every soul 's release ! 
along the street before the dead 
they smile because a soul has fled . 
when the forsaken city starts to burn , 
after the men and children have fled , 
stand still , silent as prey , and slowly turn 
back . behold the curse . stay and mourn 
the collapsing doorways , the unbroken bread 
in the forsaken city starting to burn . 
stand still , silent as prey . slowly turn 
your thoughts away from escape : the iron 
when the forsaken city starts to burn , 
surrender to your calling , show concern 
for those who remain . come to a dead 
into something essential . learn 
the names of the fallen . refuse to run ahead 
when the forsaken city starts to burn . 
stand still and silent . pray . return . 
husband , today could you and i behold 
rising so splendid in the winter sky 
( we though fair spring returned ) , when we were wed ; 
could the shades vanish from these fifteen years , 
which stand like columns guarding the approach 
to that great temple of the double soul 
that is as one - would you turn back , my dear , 
and , for the sake of love 's mysterious dream , 
as old as adam and as sweet as eve , 
take me , as i took you , and once more go 
towards that goal which none of us have reached ? 
teaching each other sacrifice of self , 
learning the joys of birth , the woe of death , 
leaving in chaos all the hopes of life- 
heart-broken , yet with courage pressing on 
or , would you rather - i will acquiesce- 
since we must choose what is , and are grown gray , 
stay in life 's desert , watch our setting sun , 
calm as those statues in egyptian sands , 
wait for a future which contains no past ? 
living , i had no might 
to make you hear , 
i am so near 
no whisper , falling light , 
living , i had no claim 
on your great hours . 
now the thin candle-flame , 
the closing flowers , 
wed summer with my name , - 
and these are ours . 
your shadow on the dust , 
strength , and a cry , 
all these am i . 
dawn , and the far hills thrust 
to a far sky . 
living , i had no skill 
to stay your tread , 
now all that was my will 
silence has said . 
we are one for good and ill 
since i am dead . 
maker-of-sevens in the scheme of things 
from earth to star ; 
thy cycle holds whatever is fate , and 
over the border the bar . 
sailing the seven seas , 
he prays , as he holds his glass to his eyes , 
i can not love them ; and i feel your glad 
that my all was only worth at all , what 
joy to you it gave . 
these seven links the law compelled 
for the human chain- 
i can not love them ; and you , oh , 
a jungle there , a cave here , bred six 
and a million years , 
sure and strong , mate for mate , such 
love as culture fears ; 
i gave you clear the oil and wine ; 
see how even life may be ere the 
but i can wait the seven of moons , 
or years i spare , 
a drop , nor share- 
a silken gown ; 
and you , glory-clad , reach down . 
in the dark we disappear , pure being . 
being alone is no way to be : thus 
loneliness is the test of pure being . 
nights in love i fell too far or not quite 
clouds , snow , mist , the dragon 's breath on water , 
smoke from fire-a metaphor 's pure being . 
stillness and more stillness and the light locked 
i was , i am , i looked within and saw 
nothing very clearly : purest being . 
was revolution . . . 
you have faults 
you hang your head down 
you read , you write , you think 
to you 
while sitting . 
( later : ) 
how are the children ? 
if in danger run to the woods . 
how faithful are your branches . 
in a rented boat - i had seen them come and go , 
those wild bees swift as tigers , their gauze wings a-glitter 
of a rotten cabbage tree , where their hive was hidden low . 
of ripe january , my friends and i 
and waiting for light to drain from the wounded sky . 
and sprang invisible through the darkening air , 
or loud with flames and falling timber , troy ! 
little enough their gold , and slight our joy . 
tragedy is written distinct and small : 
a hive burned on a cool night in summer . 
but loss is a precious stone to me , a nectar 
to the fallen heart that does not cease to fall . 
at fifty-six , having left my mother , 
my father buys a motorcycle . 
i imagine him because 
to imagine his father : there , 
hunched on his mount , 
with black boots , with bad teeth , 
between shifts at the mill , 
past creek and rock , 
past the brown mare , 
never slowing until he sees 
the bull . he stops , pulls 
his bike to the side of the road , 
where golden rod and clover grow , 
of small wild flowers . 
about what 's past , hold on when you can , i used to say , 
and when you ca n't , let go , as if memory were one of those 
turn rough . i lived , in those days , at the forest 's edge - 
the forest was real , as my life beside it was . i spent 
much of my time listening to the sounds of random , un- 
from which the occasional lost hunter would emerge 
whom i gave some money to and told no one about , 
having promised ... you must keep what you 've promised 
very close to your heart , that way you 'll never forget 
six tiny babies beneath , each 
this may sound cute to you , reading 
but one small one was left out of reach , 
a knife of fur 
i would . if i could summon the 
the belly 's swell 
i would . but instead , i stood frozen , wishing 
why it 's called wild life because of all the 
crazed emotions tangled up in 
did i tell you how 
the smallest one , black and trembling , 
should we talk now of animal heritage , their species , 
about form and focus- 
writing this when a stray goes hungry , and away . 
wild nights - wild nights ! 
were i with thee 
wild nights should be 
our luxury ! 
futile - the winds - 
to a heart in port - 
done with the compass - 
done with the chart ! 
rowing in eden - 
ah - the sea ! 
in thee ! 
about twenty years ago 
two girls came in where i worked- 
the whole shooting-match off , and i doubt 
if ever one had like hers : 
but it was the friend i took out , 
and in seven years after that 
wrote over four hundred letters , 
gave a ten-guinea ring 
i got back in the end , and met 
i met beautiful twice . she was trying 
both times ( so i thought ) not to laugh . 
parting , after about five 
and easily bored to love . 
well , useful to get that learnt . 
in my wallet are still two snaps 
and how do you survive ? your long throat , 
your red-rag-to-a-bull head ? 
you rise heavy in the night , stars drinking 
from your poppy neck . 
you move like an opera , 
you are earth 's first blood . 
how the birds love you , 
i envy your lipstick dress . 
your butterfly breath 
as your dirty red laundry 
all hangs out . 
i wished the dog could talk 
you are the man 
you are my other country 
and i find it hard going 
you are the prickly pear 
you are the sudden violent storm 
the torrent to raise the river 
to float the wounded doe 
of them , all beginning with the letter b . 
of their hues and shapes , their breeding . 
many poems have made delicate word-chimes- 
like wind-chimes not for wind but for the breath of man- 
out of their lovely names . 
at the edge of the prairie in a cabin 
when thunder comes closer to thump the roof hard 
a few of them-in a corner , brittle in a dry jar 
where a woman 's thoughtful hand left them to fade- 
as the rain begins to fall on all their supple kin 
of all colors , under a sky of one color , or none . 
we forgot about the sunset and the dark 
coming on across the plain . 
then the reason appeared : a mother 
could n't defend them both . 
something ! '' 
i thought of the rifle back at the house . 
i thought of a 
i thought of the 
the mother antelope would 
off with both twins . 
i said no . 
the antelope struck out with her 
dangling it by the nape as gently as if it were her own . 
i woke from a bird hitting the window , almost , i thought , hard 
enough to break it . 
i slid the sash up and 
stuck my head out like someone in an italian movie . 
a flicker lay 
on its back-stunned-but it was blinking steady as a railroad 
crossing . 
was there misery to put out ? 
would it come to its 
`` senses '' ? 
i thought where were you when bark beetles killed half 
my trees ? 
eat ants . 
i went back to sleep for half an hour , and dreamed , as i 
often do , of horses . 
when next i looked , the bird still lay still , still 
blinking . 
maybe , i thought , it ca n't roll over . 
so i went down and 
rolled it over . 
terrified by my touch , it came to life and flop- 
it did n't fly , but it 
did n't seem broken , either . 
i tried to find it later . 
no luck . 
it lived and flew off , or died thrust into a bush , was , apparently , 
none of my business . 
if it were thrust into a bush , i knew the ants 
would n't wait for the guest of honor to start dinner . 
traced by the painter 's hand would mimic that moth 's fragile 
painted sunset . 
on the

air through feathers ( they 
call it drumming ) hums like a wind harp or tissue paper on a comb . 
ground . 
accident . 
if you are out walking and the mother flies up , pulling 
from , you can find the eggs . 
if you go back after they hatch , you can look 
of wood . 
summer . 
so i open the window and give 
them both what they want . 
small red tin box sealed in shrink-wrap , cut open 
through my nose . cut open the official letter . a map 
position each generation . i am only fourth in line . 
stitched together with extended relatives . this ritual , 
in english 
meaning fixed purpose 
before our verbs 
to create the future 
tense . 
here , in the private life 
like the set 
of an old-time ad 
for tide 
something . 
is n't this the past 
perfect ? 
this corn is highly 
and i 'm wearing 
a pink slip . 
tired of walking and checking the lines 
and let the local men hang their gates from my eyes . 
and the cocktail-party and locker-room chatter 
choosing to drive to my next stop , i found 
perched upon a tall chalk cliff 
so large i could never easily handle him as a top . 
he 'd been added on to so many times over the centuries , 
that it was only really possible to identify him by touch : 
a little more shy , perhaps , than other guys his age , 
an abstract clock-face jutting from the pack 
and such wee-wee nuts , 
he could only be named , i whispered , patience . 
and drove away leaving a few of my burnt bones there , behind . 
will the children forgive the generation 
will they think of us as we were , 
we 'd shake our jealousy 
and carve trees into the earth 's shirt 
to sit under , 
or catch the dead 
will the children forgive what we were , 
we rose 
to set up in its braids a place 
we rarely picked flowers for the dead or went on 
with our lives 
if only that summer had given us a bit 
of time 's space before our mad departure 
will they believe ? 
moving forward 
or back ? which way 
your nightgown . 
i am still 
there . in the haze of faces 
burning . arch 
of spreading 
flame , black-haired girl 
in saddle shoes 
in a yard of violets . 
home , balancing 
buckets of carp 
on a bamboo pole . 
daughter , father , splash 
fades as i cling 
of ribs 
a bridge i take 
of arms and legs , hands with fingers 
from the gate , his daughter 
sealed in sheets , 
i draw close 
to your body , 
place my ear against flesh , 
inside water . 
a cave with arms at the mouth . 
our hero is blind : everything he hears he sees . 
a roar . the seas 
for heat , they blush . 
william 's cabbage heart shook . 
he dragged himself from the dirt . 
if he could rest his ears he could see 
& amp ; will , who were both aging 
new york city by the root & amp ; crack . 
as if there is a fig tree rooted in heaven 
& amp ; each of its leaves knows all the rules . 
8:45 a.m. hum : he saw the boy had fallen 
& amp ; neither could be the sound of hands splitting 
gold hands landed 
my lady makes me a heron 
or my leg for a stump 
the cursed in loam my 
his guts an a-readied muck . 
if your hand had been dusk- 
yellow not a lantern but winged 
-a bridge or a dove sprung 
from the dirt . 
trying to make a shape . the feathered 
thumb herring- 
bone . we would not fall . 
i brought you in from the garden since i ca n't 
stand the trees ' visions . william you will 
be there the last 
stately in ribbons . 
the eyes sewn up the air & amp ; nothing can be seen 
but visions . 
you are burst sideways like a fist in water . 
your maker staring into an apron of mud . 
thou art 
bore a hole in the man . 
thou art 
not a bloody bit , not the man . 
in the nursery of the infant century , 
and the voice of man was never dear to me , 
but the breeze 's voice-that i could understand . 
but best of all the silver willow tree . 
there stands the stump ; with foreign voices other 
willows converse , beneath our , beneath those skies , 
and i am hushed , as if i 'd lost a brother . 
because someone thirsty enough 
followed the deepening greens 
and found a spring , silver 
in the shadow of blue ridges , 
i can kneel beneath 
this spill of willow 
limbs a century later 
and drink water 
risen from roots 
to enter the evening 
through a spout , the way 
people were born , 
washing into the world 
of such trees whose bark , 
like the water i cup 
to my parched mouth , 
tastes leafy and sweet 
and has the power , 
the old ones say , to heal . 
for i have loved the blade with all my crippled 
with all my awkward soul loved it for the shine 
sheen for the ease and grace of doing what it was 
made to do for i have loved the stubborn womb 
its beloved intent have loved the hope and then 
learned to love the lack for i have loved the water 
the way it comes to me comes for me in all its 
liquid mystery for i have loved what the water 
and vein for all it claims and contains for i have 
what god hated and what he made for being 
not a remarkable wind . 
blew suddenly free and pitched 
into the middle of the road , 
it put a stop to the afternoon . 
something white and amazing 
a waiter in a clean apron 
appeared , not quite 
of our rumbling engines . 
he knelt in the hot road , 
making two figures in white , one 
leaning over the sprawled , 
broken shape of the other , 
and now so carefully gathered in . 
two wind chimes , 
one brass and prone to anger , 
one with the throat of an angel , 
sing with the storm . 
last year i lived five months 
under that shrill choir , 
into crates , from some pages 
your own voice crying . 
some days they hung still . 
the lily i gave you in april , 
blooming , strangely , in fall . 
when i counted pennies you left 
in each can , cup , and drawer , 
for remnants of you . 
the last day , the house empty , 
had nothing to toll for . 
i walked out , took them down , 
carried our mute spirits home . 
i want to always sleep beneath a bright red blanket 
of leaves . i want to never wear a coat of ice . 
i want to learn to walk without blinking . 
can return after sleeping each season , i want to walk 
out of this house wearing nothing but wind . 
i want to greet you , i want to wait for the bus with you 
weighing less than a chill . i want to fight off the bolts 
of snow . i want to fight off the wind . 
i want to be the wind and i want to fight off the wind 
with its sagging banner of isolation , its swinging 
of noise . i want to fight off the dull straight lines 
i want a brand new name . i want the pepper 's fury 
and the salt 's tenderness . i want the virtue 
of the evening rain , but not its gossip . 
i want the malice of nothing on earth . i want to enter 
and find you there . i want your lips around the bell of flesh 
at the bottom of my ear . i want to be the mirror , 
i do not want to be the yellow photograph 
or book of poems . when i leave this body , woman , 
i want to be pure flame . i want to be your song . 
in the harbor 
gulls floated 
like pieces of paper 
set adrift , little 
boat-like birds 
in the wind-tossed waves 
that drove into 
young woman 
with a lyre-not 
looking out to sea 
but glancing at the curve 
and the birds , 
those lost notes 
before rain 
water hollows stone , 
stone stops the wind . 
water , wind , stone . 
stone 's a cup of water , 
water escapes and is wind . 
stone , wind , water . 
wind sings in its whirling , 
water murmurs going by , 
wind , water , stone . 
each is another and no other : 
crossing and vanishing 
through their empty names : 
water , stone , wind . 
it 's six-thirty in the morning 
and she 's standing on the plastic ice chest 
hammer in her right , the nail 
but nothing happens next because 
she 's trying to figure out 
how to switch # 1 with # 3 . 
she must have been standing in the kitchen , 
coffee in her hand , asleep , 
when she heard it-the wind blowing 
was n't making 
because it was n't there . 
no one , including me , especially anymore believes 
till death do us part , 
but i can see what i would miss in leaving- 
the way her ankles go into the work boots 
as she stands upon the ice chest ; 
with the nail in it . 
you knew i was coming for you , little one , 
when the kettle jumped into the fire . 
and the dog crept off , groaning , 
to the deepest part of the woods . 
and called you to eat . 
but i spoke in the cold trees : 
new one , i have come for you , child hide and lie still . 
copper burned in the raw wood . 
you saw me drag toward you . 
you dug your hands into my pale , melting fur . 
i stole you off , a huge thing in my bristling armor . 
from the bushes we passed 
until they stood , naked , spread like the cleaned spines of fish . 
of the ice and the snow . i would darken and spill 
all night running , until at last morning broke the cold earth 
and i carried you home , 
a river shaking in the sun . 
eyes wide like an owl 's , an aspirin-pale face 
somewhat masked , somewhat naked , there 's no way 
to know what others see when looking at it . 
all five of the body 's senses crowd 
on this small planet a weather of hair surrounds . 
in the conversations of eyebrows , mine are whispers . 
uncertain how to change when greeting itself 
( and is it not cruel when another 's face 
my mother , my father , and my brother are found 
the same can not be said for sadness 
( and look deeper-anger hides in the jaw ) . 
the empty page of the forehead , when i raise my brows , 
fills suddenly with questions . 
and all this while i have been playing with toys 
and all this while far off in other lands 
thousands and thousands , millions and millions- 
you know-you see the pictures 
women carrying their bony infants 
men sobbing over graves 
buildings sculpted by explosion 
earth wasted bare and rotten- 
and all this while i have been shopping , i have 
been let us say free 
and do they hate me for it 
do they hate me 
to stop the blood of flowers and to reverse harmony . 
to die in the river , to die in the river . 
to hear the heart of a rat . there is no difference 
between the silver of the moon and the silver of my tribe . 
to clear the field and to run to the edge of the earth . 
to bear a crystal in the chest : the word . soap 
to look back , to look back one more time . 
and to remove the robe . the poppy has bitten the sky . 
to walk empty roads and drink shadows . 
to feel the oak at the mouth of the well . 
to stop the blood of flowers , to stop the blood of flowers . 
to lie down on a blue cabbage . 
position is where you 
put it , where it is , 
did you , for example , that 
with the white church along- 
side , lift 
all that , to what 
purpose ? how 
heavy the slow 
world is with 
everything put 
in place . some 
man walks by , a 
car beside him on 
the dropped 
road , a leaf of 
yellow color is 
going to 
fall . it 
all drops into 
place . my 
face is heavy 
with the sight . i can 
feel my eye breaking . 
you are my bread 
of my bones 
you are almost 
the sea 
you are not stone 
or molten sound 
i think 
you have no hands 
this kind of bird flies backward 
and this love 
where no light talks 
this is not time 
for crossing tongues 
( the sand here 
never shifts ) 
i think 
turned you with his toe 
and you will 
and shine 
six minutes he owns the place , 
dismal coffee bar , and us , its 
with quick cuts , the stuff down , 
not looking for anything , beneath 
or inside . homes to the last , 
in the wrist . then , he looks at us . 
who like to see him work . 
who love it when he leaves 
half spoiled by clarity . 
from this height 
before me : houses and trees are shadows 
neon flares between them like sudden fire 
empty air 
the windows up here 
but that is never what is out there . 
into the corners of the room 
and out the windows 
stake out a territory on the ragged lawn . 
in the center of things 
between the pressing of the window and air 
- a small space - 
nothing , everything . 
of leaf-hay across 
the field underneath 
the bright new blue 
the garments worn in flying dreams 
were fashioned there- 
scarves streaming like vapor trails , 
in a city like that one might sail 
the young scattered in whatever directions 
into one another , fell in love . 
so that the streets seemed haunted 
and when it came time to disappear 
and turned his back on the wind . 
i closed my eyes and stepped 
whenever the moon and stars are set , 
whenever the wind is high , 
all night long in the dark and wet , 
a man goes riding by . 
late in the night when the fires are out , 
why does he gallop and gallop about ? 
whenever the trees are crying aloud , 
and ships are tossed at sea , 
by , on the highway , low and loud , 
by at the gallop goes he . 
by at the gallop he goes , and then 
by he comes back at the gallop again . 
the flowers i planted along my road 
have lasted long despite winds and cold 
and i know that of my footsteps nothing will remain 
but a trace a cluster a drop 
to recall along the paths i 've chosen 
those evening when the light sang 
filling the palate with a promised saliva 
half-glimpsed we wo n't know how or else 
the loud reminder of the single moment 
of being nothing but entirely animal . 
for our life closed on that iridescent sphere 
-color taste perfume at their extreme limits-invokes 
time contained flowing-continual autumn 
this evening this wine that enters me to make 
my head light my tongue loose my cock happy . 
a glass of wine 
so delicious he grew 
and froze into a blue statue 
from a wave that broke 
upon his back 
and would have swept away 
the town if he 'd not tasted 
the wine and afterward the people 
they would do good deeds 
more often and plant lettuce 
everywhere while the buddha 
fly from me does all i would have stay , 
the blossoms did not stay , stayed not the frost 
in the yellow grass . every leash snapped , 
every contract void , and flying in the crows 
lingers but a moment in the graveyard oaks 
yet inside me it never stops so i ca n't tell 
who is chasing , who chased , i can sleep 
into afternoon and still wake soaring . 
into the chimneys , hey , i 'm real , say the dream- 
i hold however flies apart , the children skip 
into the park come out middle-aged 
with children of their own . your laugh 
over the phone , will it ever answer me again ? 
yet getting brighter . remember running 
barefoot across hot sand into the sea 's 
against the holiday broadway throng , 
catching your train just as it was leaving ? 
hey , it 's real , your face like a comet , 
horses coming from the field for morning 
because carried by mercury : i love you , 
i 'm coming . sure , what fluttered is now gone , 
maybe a smudge left , maybe a delicate under- 
feather only then that too , yes , rained away . 
and when the flying is flown and the heart 's 
a useless sliver in a glacier and the gown 
is dashed-down glass and the mouth rust- 
her first swimming pool . it had been 
his favorite color , exactly-just 
she had rolled up her window 
and told him to drive on , fast . 
now this act of mercy : four daughters 
dragging her to their husbands ' company picnic , 
white families on one side and them 
so he was dead for the first time 
on fourth of july-ten years ago 
had been harder , waiting for something to happen , 
and ten years before that , the girls 
last august she stood alone for hours 
in front of the t.v . set 
as a crow 's wing moved slowly through 
the white streets of government . 
that brave swimming 
mother , we 're afro-americans now ! 
what did she know about africa ? 
were there lakes like this one 
or thomas ' great mississippi 
with its sullen silks ? ( there was 
to god . ) where she came from 
was the past , 12 miles into town 
where nobody had locked their back door , 
under the company symbol , a white foot 
sprouting two small wings . 
but you must realize the material world 
is constantly crumbling under my eyes 
it 's too much for the novel tongue i speak 
of the set lips becoming a smile , and 
you must accept the thin section of arm 
we have lived through the most furious little 
we become american birds 
this is what it sounds like outside , 
that is enough to realize i 'm a pencil that has learned 
in ways you can not yet . slow goes the drag 
of creation , how what 's within comes to be without , 
winged creatures can hold their blood to warmth 
we drift from one culture to another and fight 
settle into for next to no resistance . 
so we create something else . 
will position a fluid hello of death rattles 
by not asking the questions or repeating 
the paintings that came before me , 
bullets , even as the light leaves your eyes 
so the hens and geese make us think in terms of help 
outside , how they flap and move with fat ease in front of trains , 
even as they land just so on the wires above us , 
and yellow patches blood and emptiness 
and sun and usually an angel 's wings would 
be made of only one of these but his 
were made at the last minute and were almost 
not made at all and would n't have been made 
to shove him from the cloud and saw he had 
no wings and paused and thought then pulled him back 
and so the angels stitched together what was 
near blood emptiness sun as what was near 
was heaven and what else would heaven be 
long thought to be extinct 
past the statue of two men shaking hands on horseback . 
brunette-colored coal cars . 
like a small grey infant sinking 
ever so slowly in the icy harbor . 
now , nearly thirty years later , 
ladies and gentlemen it is my great pleasure 
( the cow is led out onto the stage by a young boy dressed as a farmer . ) 
the dog breathing at the foot of the bed , 
and the windows shut tight , 
i can barely hear the geese 
flying over the living and the dead , 
think you back . 
you fail far away from me , 
waving at pain . 
and here by your name . 
things will never be the same . 
are they the same yet ? 
behold the gloomy tyrant 's awful form 
binding the captive earth in icy chains ; 
howls in the blast , and swells the rising storm . 
a fearful ruin o'er their heads to pour . 
while to the cheerful hearth and social board 
content and ease repair , the sons of want 
pink bleeds gold 
and red spills into one 's heart . 
broad leather keeps time , 
in different zones 
unaware of the grammar 
that makes sense . 
of two distant dogs 
on a very cold night 
new plants wait for new heat - 
poetry for peace - woven 
text keeping comfort in place . 
split red by mother tongues - 
winter 's breath is pink . 
the wintry west extends his blast , 
or , the stormy north sends driving forth 
while tumbling brown , the burn comes down , 
the sweeping blast , the sky o'ercast , 
let others fear , to me more dear 
than all the pride of may : 
my griefs it seems to join ; 
their fate resembles mine ! 
thou pow'r supreme , whose mighty scheme 
here , firm , i rest , they must be best , 
because they are thy will ! 
then all i want ( o , do thou grant 
this one request of mine ! ) 
since to enjoy thou dost deny , 
the night 's drifts 
pile up below me and behind my back , 
slide down the hill , rise again , and build 
in the valley below me , 
miles between me and the town of st.-jeannet , 
the road lamps glow . 
they are so cold , they might as well be dark . 
trucks and cars 
cough and drone down there between the golden 
of a rooster claws heavily across 
a grove , and drowns . 
true night still hangs on , 
a little way downhill among turning rocks , 
a square takes form in the side of a dim wall . 
no other stirring behind the dim face 
his goats are still sleeping , dreaming 
of the fresh roses 
i turn , and somehow 
than this mountain is , 
shines . a voice clearly 
to start the motor . the moon and the stars 
suddenly flicker out , and the whole mountain 
appears , pale as a shell . 
look , the sea has not fallen and broken 
our heads . how can i feel so warm 
here in the dead center of january ? i can 
scarcely believe it , and yet i have to , this is 
the only life i have . i get up from the stone . 
and follows me . now we are all sitting here strangely 
on top of the sunlight . 
dark frost was in the air without , 
the dusk was still with cold and gloom , 
when less than even a shadow came 
and stood within the room . 
but of the three around the fire , 
none turned a questioning head to look , 
still read a clear voice , on and on , 
still stooped they o'er their book . 
the children watched their mother 's eyes 
moving on softly line to line ; 
it seemed to listen too-that shade , 
yet made no outward sign . 
no cold wind stirred the wintry tree ; 
beside their mother 's knee . 
and nearer yet that spirit drew 
only on what the simple words 
of her small story meant . 
no memory her bosom stirred , 
nor dreamed she , as she read to two , 
't was surely three who heard . 
yet when , the story done , she smiled 
from face to face , serene and clear , 
a love , half dread , sprang up , as she 
leaned close and drew them near . 
memory was the room i entered down a long corridor 
thrown by the white drugs of pain though pain 
was adrift on a glassy stream of green tide 
in those days but to grab the attention 
smoking rag-cigarettes looking sideways 
for the next punishment for a break or maybe distraction 
chips of memory kept rising to the surface 
of our minds to take another bite 
a creature in the alien element of air 
of working the bait with a black beak 
there were no fish or birds so i spun my lines 
while poems of the future waited in line to hear my number 
pretty girl . the weather has knocked her down again 
and given her to the lake to wear as a skin . 
why am i always being the weather ? 
there were days in the winter 
when her smile was so lovely i felt 
the breathing of my own goodness , 
and it was like flight to bring food to her lips 
be naked and sad . she will be what happens 
to lake water that is loved and is also 
the black blood of it , the chest opened 
to reveal the inevitable heart attack . 
god , the silence of the chamber 
we watch from . what happens to water 
but the reaching out to all sides at once , 
the wet closing of what was open ? 
that is a beautiful woman . 
so of course i stand and stare , never able 
but my house grows only cleaner 
and more plain . the glass chimes i hung 
over the register ring a little 
when the heat goes on . 
i waited too long to drink my tea . 
it was not hot . it was only warm . 
i tell my secret ? no indeed , not i ; 
perhaps some day , who knows ? 
but not today ; it froze , and blows and snows , 
you want to hear it ? well : 
only , my secret 's mine , and i wo n't tell . 
or , after all , perhaps there 's none : 
suppose there is no secret after all , 
but only just my fun . 
in which one wants a shawl , 
a veil , a cloak , and other wraps : 
i wear my mask for warmth : who ever shows 
his nose to russian snows 
you would not peck ? i thank you for good will , 
march with its peck of dust , 
nor april with its rainbow-crowned brief showers , 
nor even may , whose flowers 
perhaps some languid summer day , 
when drowsy birds sing less and less , 
and golden fruit is ripening to excess , 
if there 's not too much sun nor too much cloud , 
and the warm wind is neither still nor loud , 
perhaps my secret i may say , 
or you may guess . 
and salt-trucks flashing yellow , drifts 
i sit by the window and watch the snow 
blow sideways north-northeast , hot cup 
in hand , robe over pajamas . 
you have made me to seek refuge 
and charged me to care for my brothers . 
how cruel . that could be you out there 
howling , cracking the trees , burying everything . 
what could i possibly want from you 
that would not undo the whole world as it is ? 
a cold night crosses 
our path 
the world appears 
very large , very 
far as the moon does 
it is from 
the moon this cold travels 
it is 
the light of the moon that causes 
this night reflecting distance in its own 
light so coldly 
( from one side of 
the earth to the other ) 
it is the long distance 
between two points which are 
not in a line now 
not a 
straight ) but a curve only , 
silver that is a rock reflecting 
not metal 
( a scream in silence 
where between the two 
points what touches 
is a curve around the world 
vines , leaves , roots of darkness , growing , 
with the edge of winter sky 
leaning over us in icy stars . 
vines , leaves , roots of darkness , growing , 
come with your seasons , your fullness , your end . 
night is the time for the old to die - 
father lay moaning , her fault was sore 
( night is the time when the old must die ) , 
yet , ah to bless her , my child , once more , 
for heart is failing : the end is nigh . 
daughter , my daughter , my girl , i cried 
( night is the time for the old to die ) 
heavily plunged from the roof the snow - 
( night is the time when the old will die ) , 
she answered , my mother , 't is well , i go . 
first at his head , and last at his feet 
( night is the time when the old should die ) , 
kneeling i watched till his soul did fleet , 
none else that loved him , none else were nigh . 
i wept in the night as the desolate weep 
( night is the time for the old to die ) , 
across the cold hollows how white they lie . 
i sought her afar through the spectral trees 
( night is the time when the old must die ) , 
( night is the time when the old should die ) , 
but she lay stiff by the locked mill-wheel , 
and the old stars lived in their homes on high . 
my father once broke a man 's hand 
with a sharpened fruit knife , & amp ; he held 
the curved tip of it , lightly , between his first 
two fingers , so it could slash 
across a throat . it was like a glinting beak in a hand , 
and , for a moment , the light held still 
on those vines . when it was over , 
my father simply went in & amp ; ate lunch , & amp ; then , as always , 
lay alone in the dark , listening to music . 
he never mentioned it . 
i never understood how anyone could risk his life , 
sometimes , i go out into this yard at night , 
and stare through the wet branches of an oak 
in winter , & amp ; realize i am looking at the stars 
again . a thin haze of them , shining 
it used to make me feel lighter , looking up at them . 
in california , that light was closer . 
in a california no one will ever see again , 
my father is beginning to die . something 
inside him is slowly taking back 
every word it ever gave him . 
now , if we try to talk , i watch my father 
search for a lost syllable as if it might 
solve everything , & amp ; though he ca n't remember , now , 
the word for it , he is ashamed . . . 
if you can think of the mind as a place continually 
visited , a whole city placed behind 
the eyes , & amp ; shining , i can imagine , now , its end- 
as when the lights go off , one by one , 
in a hotel at night , until at last 
all of the travelers will be asleep , or until 
of sleep ; & amp ; while the woman behind the desk 
you can almost believe that the elevator , 
i stand out on the street , & amp ; do not go in . 
and for years i believed 
i got it all wrong . 
tonight , i 'm talking to you , father , although 
the size of a wrist , wakes the cold again- 
which may be all that 's left of you & amp ; me . 
when i left home at seventeen , i left for good . 
that pale haze of stars goes on & amp ; on , 
like laughter that has found a final , silent shape 
on a black sky . it means everything 
it can not say . look , it 's empty out there , & amp ; cold . 
even a father , even a son . 
i went out at night alone ; 
the young blood flowing beyond the sea 
seemed to have drenched my spirit 's wings- 
i bore my sorrow heavily . 
but when i lifted up my head 
from shadows shaken on the snow , 
i saw orion in the east 
burn steadily as long ago . 
from windows in my father 's house , 
dreaming my dreams on winter nights , 
i watched orion as a girl 
above another city 's lights . 
years go , dreams go , and youth goes too , 
the world 's heart breaks beneath its wars , 
all things are changed , save in the east 
the faithful beauty of the stars . 
how valuable it is in these short days , 
threading through empty maple branches , 
the lacy-needled sugar pines . 
its glint off sheets of ice tells the story 
of death 's brightness , her bitter cold . 
we can make do with so little , just the hint 
and how carefully we gather what we can 
to offer later , in darkness , one body to another . 
stiffened all that met his glare : 
horses , men and lice . 
visited a forward post , 
left them burning , ear to foot ; 
fingers stuck to biting steel , 
toes to frozen boot . 
stalked on into no man 's land , 
saw two figures gleaming there ; 
gaunt in the grey air . 
glassy-eyed , with glinting heel 
torn by screaming steel . 
as horses as for 
as purple as we go 
as heartbeat as if 
as onion as i can 
as cherries as feared 
as dog collar as expected 
as umbrella as catch can 
as hit parade as all that 
as dictionary as you like 
as shadow as promised 
as drinking fountain as well 
as mirror as is 
as never as this 
i thought about his death for so many hours , 
tangled there in the wires of the night , 
that it came to have a body and dimensions , 
more than a voice shaking over the telephone 
his death now had an entrance and an exit , 
doors and stairs , 
windows and shutters which are the motionless wings 
of windows . his death had a head and clothes , 
his death had pages , a dark leather cover , an index , 
and locked , 
to the wind , and a mirror in which you could see the past . 
his death had sockets and keys , it had walls and beams . 
it had a handle which you could not hold and a floor 
you could not lie down on in the middle of the night . 
his death to bed with me and his death was my bed 
and in every corner of the room it hid from the light , 
and then it was the light of day and the next day 
and all the days to follow , and it moved into the future 
like the sharp tip of a pen moving across an empty page . 
by new names 
and then no names 
at all , their laws 
will reach your land , 
on your much loved 
whose occasional faces 
discern a stranger 
from far off 
but like to take 
a break from well 
to talk . we can- 
a place from those 
it 's made of , the sounds 
it makes . but now 
to washington , 
thin ; more things 
sound or work 
the same . their laws 
will reach your land , 
then no names at all . 
for the young man who would have 
between her lips lies death . 
the young man learns that as his bride he should instead have taken 
wisdom to him . 
wisdom is the words that figure her as 
fear of the lord . 
the young men 
pride comes , 
then comes shame . 
let a man meet rather 
than with folly . 
good from those to whom it is due . 
the lord 's eyes are on 
every place , 
as on 
hell and destruction . whose 
order was it 
that made the ends of the earth ? 
who put clothes on the deep ? 
what is his name , and what is his 
son 's name , 
if you can tell ? 
wisdom can . still a child , 
divided the waters . 
it was no one but 
god 's to do 
to divide what 
is n't said 
from what is . 
if god was 
male already , 
wisdom was not male . 
( it may have been wisdom 's 
difference from god that let god speak 
good into being . ) 
was god 's delight . 
she was with him over the waters . 
deep would have lasted 
had god not given it form . 
it made god tremble that his call for it to be 
light there 
would not let 
night touch day . ( there had to be room 
between them 
or they could n't be what 
god said they were . ) 
god and 
wisdom were two . 
day and night were two also . 
day gave it to be seen at once that 
down was 
up . 
the deep had a face . 
god 's breath 
hovered over it until there was 
wind there instead . 
the wind is in force in 
many places over the earth 's dry land . 
its going 
on like that 
and still not be seen . 
a door woke me . 
it was having to 
open and then flap shut against 
the stable 's north wall . 
there 'd be 
a minute or more of only the wind . 
the wind had become something the trees had had between them for 
days now . 
they 'd showed to their tops that they 'd be moved 
only so much . 
at the same time that it was many trees , 
the night wind i was hearing them in was 
one . ( one has to be the number 
god has 
against the too-many-to-count . ) 
if it had a back to it 
in those places how far north where 
right then it was quiet , 
the wind 's broad front was as high as 
just below god . 
( that 's where god starts to be a different 
nothing than wind . ) 
if nothing 's 
around the wind to any of its sides , 
god 's around all . inside all god holds , 
wisdom 's at the work of meaning for the faithful that there 's 
good to be had , 
i wanted to be asleep so i would n't go on making 
god up out of the wind . 
make biscuits in kitchen b 
miss scarlet with her lead pipe 
waits behind the cupboard door 
clubs one from the other limp 
only to begin again innocent 
& amp ; nothing to do but gather into 
coming along then a spider its web 
holds the walls together holds the floor 
up gathers toward a central point 
to insert a thumb & amp ; see what sticks 
that nine wonders hope the clouds have 
answers hope the clouds have 
i wanted to give you something for your pain . 
something you would n't find on a talk show , 
i wanted to give you something for your pain 
but i could n't imagine what . 
i needed something that would n't have occurred 
to you or me , or even nature : a creature 
out-of-mind , one-of-a-kind 
longer than a day , go deeper than the past . 
if i thought that would suffice . 
i wanted to give you something 
that did n't arrive with a roll of the dice 
something for your pain that did n't smack 
but it 's been done ( and besides , its desolate dust 
if i could have given you something 
without a second thought , i would have . 
a splendid view , perhaps , or a strain 
of music . a favorite dish . a familiar tree . 
and never once tire , never complain . 
but when all was said and done 
( or hardly said , not nearly done ) 
i was as helpless as you . could you tell- 
or were you so overcome your pain was all 
that mattered ? it seemed to me we were a kind 
but the heart , once shattered , never quite matching 
in spite of pain , you knew to hold hope 
as lightly as you held my hand ( a phantom grasp , 
a clasp that seemed to come from the other side ) . 
by my wish to please . and then you died . 
i ask not wit , nor beauty do i crave , 
but since , 't is doomed through all degrees of life , 
whether a daughter , sister , or a wife ; 
since this , i say , is ev'ry woman 's fate , 
to me a kind , and faithful friend , 
one who to virtue 's laws is true , 
and to his passions not a slave ; 
who full of honour , void of pride , 
who still the same will ever prove , 
and with him all my cares divide : 
a wit both quick , and solid too : 
who can of all things talk with ease , 
and whose converse will ever please : 
who charm 'd with wit , and inward graces , 
and still a beauteous mind does prize 
i would not envy queens their state , 
nor once desire a happier fate . 
i wish them a strange town 
i wish them no 7-11 . 
i wish them one week early 
and wearing a white skirt . 
i wish them one week late . 
later i wish them hot flashes 
would n't believe . let the 
flashes come when they 
meet someone special . 
when they want to . 
let them think they have accepted 
not unlike themselves . 
you are food . 
you are here for me 
and i will like you better . 
your brother will be first , 
you must wait your turn . 
feed him yourself , you will 
learn to do it . you will take him 
torn apart and leaking butter , fried meats 
late in the morning , and always sweets 
in a sticky parade from the kitchen . 
he will forget . he will thank you 
for it . his little finger stuck every day 
through cracks in the bars 
will grow sleek and round , 
his hollow face swell 
like the moon . he will stop dreaming 
about fear in the woods without food . 
he will lean toward the maw 
of the oven as it opens 
every afternoon , sighing 
better and better smells . 
i 'll conjure the perfect easter 
my pink gloves & amp ; your green gloves 
like parrots from an opera over the earth- 
we 'll chatter about our enemies ' spectacular deaths . 
i 'll conjure the perfect easter 
& amp ; my pink gloves . your gloves are green 
& amp ; transparent like the skin of christ 
i 'll conjure as perfect an easter : 
i conjure with my pink-and-green gloves 
& amp ; it 's easter . i dig up body after body after body 
with my pink gloves , my green gloves . 
words shouting , singing , smiling , frowning- 
sense lacking . 
i was cold and leaned against the big oak tree 
as if it were my mother wearing a rough apron 
through those boughs and leaves i saw 
dark patches of sky . i thought a brooding 
witch waited to catch me up from under 
i looked to the roof of mom and dad 's house 
from a window and waved . when the bus came , 
and took my first step toward not returning . 
what every painter knows , but most others forget 
is how bright colors dim in artificial light 
and lobster tastes most fresh 
the nearer to death 
you set your teeth into the lobster 's flesh . 
like a monstrous snail , a toilet slides into a living room on a track of wet , demanding to be loved . 
the toilet slides away ... 
with spring in our flesh 
the cranes come back , 
cold and black . 
and we go out to them , 
go out into the town , 
asking them down . 
the winter flies away 
when the cranes cross . 
it falls into the north , 
let no one call it back 
when the cranes fly , 
silver birds , red-capped , 
down the long sky . 
if you think you know enough to say this poem 
is about good hair , i 'll correct you 
and tell you it 's about history 
i see knuckles and teeth for sale 
face of the fourteen-year-old boy . 
that is not mine , your gaze shifting between 
me and the author 's photo , whispering , 
but that 's not you ? i do not 
feel sorry for you . no . i think only that when a man 
is a concept he will tell you about the smell 
of smoke . he will tell you the distance 
between heartbreak and rage . 
nights , by the light of whatever would burn : 
of wheat that were another silk : worm soul 
spun the one , yellow seed in the dark soil , the other . 
the fields lay fallow , swollen with frost , 
of our gowns ; we had hung back like shadows 
on the walls of trees and watched . in the little circles 
words that bled through the bars 
of iron masks : the lord 
who sold us to the glory fields , lied . 
elizabeth bishop leaned on a table , it cracked , 
both fell to the floor . a gesture 
in florida , where she was surrounded 
by rotting abundance and greedy insects . 
one moment a laughing smile , a graceful hand 
a casual shift of weight , 
the shell of the table 
true , it was a fall from no great height- 
merely the height of herself , 
and although the hollowed-out table failed , 
at least the floor held , 
how can you tell ? 
and how could she , smiling and easy , 
have forgotten fear , apparently 
let go of a hard-learned lesson ? 
enter a room as though it is strange . 
what you recognize may have changed , 
or may change without warning . 
have vanished or died or stopped loving you . 
once , i lit three twigs and fanned the smoke , 
from miles away , 
but not without aches of my own . 
did the sack of no echoes fail me ? 
now , on such a mild curse- 
how far will this go ? 
these pangs are power are power as both 
knees lock up 
ashamed to move under me . 
it 's not a wary stare-wolf , 
it 's short and fat , it tips its hat , 
unlike a scary glare-wolf . 
it is a fairly rare wolf , 
that 's only there to clean its clothes- 
it is a wash-and-wear-wolf . 
from whatever they find , 
setting a place at their table 
for animal and divine nature 
it was the week of asking . asking 
to watch her eat . asking if she understood 
the doctors ' questions . asking her 
to explain the difference between 
wanting to die right now , and dying later . 
the tumor making certain answers 
to the incense dish from which 
someone swept all the ashes up . asking 
if she recognized us . because that 
is what the living want : thinking 
it is a sign we have been loved . 
but the answer was a summer drive , 
a mountain , piles of leaves beneath which 
some deaths are good 
and it makes them hard to grieve . 
she was , at times , in great pain . we wanted her 
to die , too . that was important . but first 
we wanted her to remember . 
from the bed , a finger pressed 
at night while the dogs 
were barking 
with knives 
were men we did n't like 
the new moon ones were wolves 
i would cut a belly this way 
he would cut a belly that way 
the flies 
came around the sweet juice 
it was blood to us 
we tasted it we licked it off the blades 
we decided not to kill the wolves 
we wanted to be wolves 
we stuck the knives in the ground 
we turned the pilot caps inside out 
so the fur would show 
that way when we crawled 
under the bob wire 
a little piece would get caught 
we would n't though 
we wanted to leave trails 
we wanted to be wolves 
and in the morning all those dead men 
with their hearts eat out 
cloth from the moon . cloth from another planet . 
and i ... . 
this print of mine , that has kept its color 
navy i wear to work , and wear from work , and so 
to my bed , so to my grave , with no 
in the eyes of animals , these beings trapped 
as i am trapped but not , themselves , the trap , 
aging , but without knowledge of their age , 
kept safe here , knowing not of death , for death- 
oh , bars of my own body , open , open ! 
the world goes by my cage and never sees me . 
and there come not to me , as come to these , 
tearing the meat the flies have clouded ... . 
when you come for the white rat that the foxes left , 
take off the red helmet of your head , the black 
wings that have shadowed me , and step to me as man : 
the wild brother at whose feet the white wolves fawn , 
you know what i was , 
you see what i am : change me , change me ! 
sunk to the wrist in the rustling grain 
around a sifting handful . it 's like rain , 
like cupping water in your hand , she thinks , 
so rich a fragrance she has never quite 
got used to it , under the seeming spell 
hens bunch and strut , heads cocked , with tilted eyes , 
till her hand sweeps out and the small grain flies . 
the shed behind the barn behind the red cottage i wait 
wait for my friends in the distance on fire their full heads 
of rust ( i love how the clothing drips off them i hear myself say ) 
a stalk of honey and the rye grass grows from her arms 
is it peace , 
on the dump ? 
out of the cracks of cups and their handles , missing , 
of the far-flung future , enough evidence 
to be read out before animal sacrifice , 
the milk , ground meat , beer , and soap 
over tomatoes splitting their sides , 
flattened into mosaic petal from petal , 
and , having moved it , move on , 
if the art of loneliness is landscape , 
now thou has loved me one whole day , 
tomorrow when you leav'st , what wilt thou say ? 
or say that now 
we are not just those persons which we were ? 
dispute and conquer , if i would , 
for by tomorrow , i may think so too . 
a woman 's looks 
are barbed hooks , 
that catch by art 
when yet they spend no breath . 
but let them speak , 
and sighing break 
forth into tears , 
their words are spears 
that wound our souls to death . 
is made forget , 
and like a child 
is oft beguiled 
with love 's sweet-seeming bait . 
love with his rod 
so like a god 
commands the mind 
we can not find , 
time , that all things 
in order brings , 
hath taught me now 
to be more slow 
in giving faith to speech : 
since women 's words 
and when they kiss 
they think by this 
making his home an earthly paradise , 
rich in all joys allotted to life 's span ; 
with all the gentle influence of love 's might , 
seeking no joy wherein he has no part - 
it is her right to teach the infant mind , 
training it ever upward in its course , 
to root out evil passions that would bind 
the upward current of his reason 's force ; 
when it has sunk in gloom of deepest night ; 
to point the shining path of virtue 's track , 
and urge him forward . this is woman 's right . 
it is her right to soothe the couch of pain ; 
there her pure mission upon earth to prove , 
through the bright day , and in the solemn night , 
to rest for ever . this is woman 's right . 
she is a flower that blossoms best , unseen , 
let her not scorn to act a woman 's part , 
moon marked and touched by sun 
my magic is unwritten 
but when the sea turns back 
it will leave my shape behind . 
i seek no favor 
untouched by blood 
permanent as my errors 
or my pride 
i do not mix 
love with pity 
nor hate with scorn 
and if you would know me 
where the restless oceans pound . 
i do not dwell 
and still seeking 
my sisters 
as our mother did 
mourning . 
i have been woman 
for a long time 
beware my smile 
and the noon 's new fury 
i am 
and not white . 
lightning hits the roof , 
deep in the walls . 
they bleed light all over us 
and your face , the fan , folds up , 
so i wo n't see how afraid 
to be with me you are . 
we do n't mix , even in bed , 
where we keep ending up . 
there 's no need to hide it : 
you 're snow , i 'm coal , 
i 've got the scars to prove it . 
but open your mouth , 
i 'll give you a taste of black 
you wo n't forget . 
for a while , i 'll let it make you strong , 
make your heart lion , 
then i 'll take it back . 
i am not born as yet , 
five minutes before my birth . 
i can still go back 
now it 's ten minutes before , 
now , it 's one hour before birth . 
i go back , 
i run 
ten years before , 
a hundred and fifty years before , 
i walk , my steps thump , 
in which there was no me . 
the middle ages , where i would have carried water in a tavern . 
i walk still further , 
what an echo , 
my steps thump 
through the reverse of life . 
i reach adam and eve , 
nothing is seen anymore , it 's dark . 
had i been really born . 
in the ocean one fish 
swallows the other : 
loss . 
you are bigger than i . 
the calamity of love 
swelling out larger than us . 
swallows the cause and effect : 
parts wanting to breathe and wanting . 
there is no gentle sense to this . 
is there ? 
only a kind of terror 
at the chain 
of events , the scale of loss , the ordered 
destruction one against the other- 
all that something larger 
the woman who can not bring forth her child : go to a dead man 's grave and then step three times over the grave , and then say these words three times : 
this is my cure for the bitter black-birth 
and when that woman is with child and she goes to her lord in his bed , then let her say : 
up i go , over you i step , 
with a full-born one , not a doomed one . 
and when the mother feels the child is quick , go then to a church , and when she comes before the altar say then : 
christ , i said it . this has been uttered . 
i sell it , you sell it . 
this blackened wool , this sorrow seed . 
translated from the old english 
has a moth in her palm , 
a river on her tongue , 
a lump in her throat , 
a fire in her den , 
a shadow in her flesh , 
a flutter in her breast , 
like everybody else . 
as dawn breaks he enters 
a room with the odor of acid . 
he lays the copper plate on the table . 
all the news is famine and famine . 
the angle tint tool wait for him . 
he bends to his work and begins . 
he starts with the head , cutting in 
to the line of the cheek , finding 
the shape of a face that becomes 
with a deeper cut into copper - 
the whole woman as a skeleton , 
the rags of her skirt , her wrist 
in a bony line forever 
her body from its native air until 
she is ready for the page , 
to loss and to laissez-faire adds 
the odor of acid and the little , 
he puts his tools away , 
one by one ; lays them out carefully 
on the deal table , his work done . 
science was the music of our minds . our sexual 
to fade so we could slip into something less 
our minds snatched at whatever rushed by . 
hush , hush , my love . these things happened 
a long time ago . you need n't be afraid of them , now . 
women have no wilderness in them , 
content in the tight hot cell of their hearts 
to eat dusty bread . 
they do not hear 
shallow and clear . 
they wait , when they should turn to journeys , 
to which no man is friend . 
they can not think of so many crops to a field 
or of clean wood cleft by an axe . 
they hear in every whisper that speaks to them 
a shout and a cry . 
as like as not , when they take life over their door-sills 
they should let it go by . 
making promises they ca n't keep . 
for you , grandmother , i said i would pull 
take from the ground the dark oily poison- 
all to restore you happy and proud , 
the whole of you transformed 
and bursting into tomorrow . 
but where do i cut first ? 
where should i begin to pull ? 
should it be the russian thistle 
above the wind ? or the middle finger 
of my right hand ? or my left eye 
or the other one ? or a slice 
from the small of my back , a slab of fat 
from my thigh ? i am broken 
as much as any native ground , 
my daughters were never born , i am 
as much the last day of life as the first . 
to tremble and rage against alien weight . 
who should blossom ? who should receive pollen ? 
who watered , who picked ? 
should i feed the white-faced cattle 
who wait for the death train to come 
or comb the wild seeds from their tails ? 
who should return across the sea 
or the mother ground ? who should go screaming 
to some other planet , burn up or melt 
in a distant sun ? who should be healed 
and who hurt ? who should dry 
at the first sign of drought ? who should be remembered ? 
alien with a native face , 
native with an alien face ? 
to c.o. , different forms , desks-mouth open , turn-so 
slow i use the time to practice patience , 
grace , tenderness for glassed-in guards . the rules 
my hair up . i can not wear my hair up . i dressed 
a movie star . when i stood at the front of the class 
there rose a sharp collective sigh . the one 
to tell her . then she told me : freedom is wasted 
on women like me . they hate the dark cotton , jeans 
they have to wear , each one a shadow of the other their 
whole sentence.you could wear red ! she accused . 
their favorite dresses , silk slips , wool socks all long gone , 
i take it off and pass it around , let each woman hold it 
a familiar gesture , second nature , from another world . 
they are thin 
and rarely marry , living out 
their long lives 
giving view to formal gardens 
in the late afternoon 
tilting their heads 
at a gracious angle 
as if listening 
to notes pitched above 
the human range . 
age makes them translucent ; 
visible at temple or neck . 
when they die , it 's in their sleep , 
their spirits shaking gently loose 
to protest . 
women who sleep on stones are like 
brick houses that squat alone in cornfields . 
but at dusk a second-story light is always burning . 
used to be i loved nothing more 
that collect good water in their hollows . 
stars came close without the trees 
but does n't the body foil what it loves best ? 
now my hips creak and their blades are tender . 
my gut to night creatures who might come along 
and rip it open with a beak or hoof . 
dark passes as i shift from side to side 
women who sleep on stones do n't sleep . 
the next day they 're sore all over and glad 
for the ache : that 's how stubborn they are . 
how like an angel came i down ! 
how bright are all things here ! 
when first among his works i did appear 
o how their glory me did crown ! 
the world resembled his eternity , 
in which my soul did walk ; 
and ev'ry thing that i did see 
did with me talk . 
the lively , lovely air ; 
oh how divine , how soft , how sweet , how fair ! 
the stars did entertain my sense , 
and all the works of god , so bright and pure , 
so rich and great did seem , 
as if they ever must endure 
a native health and innocence 
within my bones did grow , 
and while my god did all his glories show , 
that was all spirit . i within did flow 
with seas of life , like wine ; 
i nothing in the world did know 
but 't was divine . 
harsh ragged objects were conceal 'd , 
were hid , and only things reveal 'd 
which heav'nly spirits , and the angels prize . 
the state of innocence 
did fill my sense . 
the boys and girls were mine , 
oh how did all their lovely faces shine ! 
the sons of men were holy ones , 
in joy and beauty they appear 'd to me , 
and every thing which here i found , 
while like an angel i did see , 
adorn 'd the ground . 
rich diamond and pearl and gold 
in ev'ry place was seen ; 
mine eyes did everywhere behold . 
great wonders cloth 'd with glory did appear , 
that and my wealth was ev'ry where : 
no joy to this ! 
flew from the splendour of mine eyes , 
and so did hedges , ditches , limits , bounds , 
i dream 'd not aught of those , 
but wander 'd over all men 's grounds , 
and found repose . 
my joys by others worn : 
for me they all to wear them seem 'd 
when i was born . 
at dusk , on those evenings she does not go out , 
there , no one to tell what to do , 
she wanders , sometimes she talks to herself , 
throws out her arms and screams-high notes 
lying here and there on the carpets 
i feel , now , that i do not know her , 
and for all my staring , i have not seen her 
-like the song she sang , when we were small , 
i wonder as i wander , out under the sky , 
how jesus , the savior , was born for , to die , 
for poor lonely people , like you , and like i 
and never does it not look fresh , 
as though its insides were n't moist 
or warm crust not the kind that spices 
a room with the plump aroma of toast . 
found on the table ; among shadows 
someone , possibly more than one 
person , loves me . well then , who ? 
amazing that bread should be so weightless , 
down-light when handled , as a me 
dying to taste it takes a slice . 
which lasts just long enough to reach 
my mouth , but then , at the first bite , 
nothing ! nothing but air , thin air ... . 
get rid of it , throw it in the river- 
beyond which , grain fields . future food for the just 
and the unjust , those who love , and do not love . 
set in place , feet spread apart- 
through the two new halves 
to leave the steel head sunk 
a half-inch in the block and the ash 
handle rigid in the air . 
a smack of the palm , gripping as it hits 
the butt end , and the blade 
rolls out of the cut . the half-logs 
so much less than what we have been 
for if the stacked cords 
speak of felled trees , of countless 
till the blood is wrung from your back 
so far off you would rather freeze , 
yet each thin tongue torn from the grain 
will sing in the stove . 
to remind you of hands . of how 
mere touch is song in the silence 
where hands live-the song of muddy bark , 
and the song of one hand over another , 
two of us holding the last length of the log 
out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day , 
i paused and said , 'i will turn back from here . 
no , i will go on farther-and we shall see . ' 
the hard snow held me , save where now and then 
one foot went through . the view was all in lines 
straight up and down of tall slim trees 
too much alike to mark or name a place by 
so as to say for certain i was here 
or somewhere else : i was just far from home . 
a small bird flew before me . he was careful 
to put a tree between us when he lighted , 
and say no word to tell me who he was 
who was so foolish as to think what he thought . 
he thought that i was after him for a feather- 
the white one in his tail ; like one who takes 
everything said as personal to himself . 
and then there was a pile of wood for which 
i forgot him and let his little fear 
carry him off the way i might have gone , 
without so much as wishing him good-night . 
he went behind it to make his last stand . 
it was a cord of maple , cut and split 
and piled-and measured , four by four by eight . 
and not another like it could i see . 
and it was older sure than this year 's cutting , 
or even last year 's or the year 's before . 
had wound strings round and round it like a bundle . 
what held it though on one side was a tree 
still growing , and on one a stake and prop , 
someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks 
he spent himself , the labor of his ax , 
and leave it there far from a useful fireplace 
to warm the frozen swamp as best it could 
little soul , 
do you remember ? 
you once walked 
over wooden boards 
to a house 
it was early . 
the sun painted 
brightness onto the water , 
and wherever you sat 
that path 
led directly to you . 
some mornings 
the sea-road was muted 
scratched tin , 
some mornings blinding . 
then it would leave . 
little soul , 
it is strange - 
even now it is early . 
it is autumn but early . no crow cries from the dry woods . 
cuts at the flies with a spectral tail . a blind man 's 
sentence , the road goes on . lifts as the slope lifts it . 
comes now one who has been conquered 
by all he sees . and asks what-would have what- 
poor fool , frail , this man , mistake , my hero ? 
more than the hands on the lines and the back aching , 
the daily wrestle with the angel in the south forty , 
more than this forever lonely round 
which asks of love more leave than extended credit , 
worn acres even if over them 
those trained to it see signs of they say god . 
it turns out there 's a difference between a detail 
and an image . if the dandelion on the sidewalk is 
is an image because it moves when her body does , 
even when a shirt covers the little thorny black sun 
on a thin stalk . the same way that the bar code 
on the back of another friend 's neck is just a detail , 
until you hear that the row of numbers underneath 
are the numbers his grandfather got on his arm 
i know the difference does n't matter , except in poetry , 
where a coffin is just another coffin until someone 
at a funeral calls it a wooden overcoat , an image 
so heavy and warm at the same time that you forget 
it 's about death . at my uncle 's funeral , the coffin 
funerals , where everything the dead person owned 
sentence , is the horse a detail or an image ? i do n't 
really know . in my mind , a horse is never anywhere 
near a fire , and a detail is as luminous as an image . 
the trumpet vine on the sagging fence . the clothes 
in the fire . and each tattoo that i touch on your back : 
the four-leaf clover , the clock face stopped at 12:05 . 
the brightly-painted horse 
had a boy 's face , 
and four small wheels 
under his feet , 
plus a long string 
to pull him by this way and that 
across the floor , 
should you care to . 
a string in-waiting 
that slipped away 
from each and every try . 
knock and they 'll answer , 
mother told me . 
so i climbed four flights of stairs 
and found a small wooden toy 
for the taking 
and the fading daylight 
that still gives me a shudder 
as if i held the key to mysteries in my hand . 
where 's the lost and found department , 
and the quiet entry , 
of the few clear moments 
of our blurred lives ? 
where 's the drop of blood 
as i bent down to touch the toy 
and caught its eye ? 
evening light , 
make me a sunday 
go-to meeting shadow 
for my toy . 
my dearest memories are 
steep stair-wells 
in dusty buildings 
on dead-end streets , 
where i talk to the walls 
and closed doors 
as if they understood me . 
the wooden toy sitting pretty . 
like the sound of eyebrows 
in a silent movie . 
to drill the house wall . 
put a pie plate over one place , he chooses another . 
there is nothing good to eat there : 
he has found in the house 
but where is the female he drums for ? where ? 
i ask this , who am myself the ruined siding , 
the handsome red-capped bird , the missing mate . 
i took the dog and went to walk 
but not to get away from things . 
it was our habit , that was all , 
a thing we did on summer days , 
and much there was to listen to . 
a slight wind came and went 
in three birches by the pond . 
a crow uphill was going on 
about the black life it led , 
with no record of ever having 
been understood by anyone . 
a deep hole from the sound of it 
in a stand of dead trees up there . 
and then a jay , much put upon , 
it may or may not have endured , 
broke the silence we were in . 
the dog stood still and looked at me , 
the woods by then already dark . 
much later , on the porch at night , 
the dog , still with me , heard it too , 
a call that came from where we 'd been , 
and where we would not be again . 
in the mud of a tire rut , 
we said the clubs in the hands of the chicago cops 
what did we do to be so red , white , and blue ? 
he was all teeth and amp 
and what were we ? 
for a.b . 
she said god . he seems to be there 
when i call on him but calling 
has been difficult too . painful . 
it 's often those 
who talk a streak 
on world affairs 
and love and peace 
who seem to love 
and peace the least . 
one thing you know when you say it : 
all over the earth people are saying it with you ; 
at a street light , a man in a wool cap , 
he says , please . 
by the time you hear what he 's saying , 
the light changes , the cab pulls away , 
and you do n't go back , though you know 
someone just prayed to you the way you pray . 
please : a word so short 
it could get lost in the air 
as it floats up to god like the feather it is , 
knocking and knocking , and finally 
falling back to earth as rain , 
and you walk in that weather every day . 
the simple contact with a wooden spoon and the word 
eyes curled outside themes to search the paper 
entered its continent eager to find another as 
capable as a thorn . the nearest possession would 
house them both , they being then two might glide 
into this house and presently create a rather larger 
as a newly laid table where related objects might gather 
choose and savor before swallowing so much was the 
toss them like pennies in the air- 
angry words , 
cruel words , 
but the slowly wrought words of love 
are birds 
that arrive 
with books 
and spring 
the wind 
and trees 
some words 
are messengers 
that come 
from far away 
from distant lands 
for them 
there are 
no borders 
only stars 
moon and sun 
some words 
are familiar 
others are exotic 
some can stand 
the cold 
with the sun 
to the south 
some words 
they 're difficult 
to translate 
and others 
build nests 
warm them 
feed them 
teach them 
how to fly 
and one day 
they go away 
in flocks 
the letters 
on this page 
are the prints 
they leave 
by the sea 
we would go down to the fish market early 
to cleanse our vision : the fish were silver , 
and scarlet , and green , and the color of sea . 
with its silvery scales . we thought of return . 
lovely too the women with jars on their heads , 
olive-brown clay , shaped softly like thighs : 
we each thought of our women , their voices , 
their laughs , the way they walked down the street . 
and each of us laughed . and it rained on the sea . 
in the sky , color . and we were alone there . 
we thought of return the way a man thinks 
of morning after an utterly sleepless night . 
we took pleasure in the color of fish and the glisten 
of fruit , all so alive in the musk of the sea . 
the trouble with paradise is you never want to be away from home . 
i make what calls me out . 
all gone before you know it . 
words may drop passing color yet seeing you here now are born again , and again . 
closing a word in the mouth feels the sound until the tongue ca n't stay still . 
language makes no promise to communicate . 
her presence in the room gives aroma to the syllables i voice . 
through thoroughly , as a word weighs . 
if i could begin anything 
i 'd say stop asking forgiveness , especially 
theirs which was always 
the fault mentioned in your condition . 
the moment they brush your 
to catch your glance . 
what is it to say that among the hired boats 
we carried our bodies well , cracked 
jokes , left the gaps 
in our lives and not 
the page ? this far to learn 
the boat does not touch the water ! 
and if this is goodbye , 
it is a light nowhere near believing 
and i am happy 
and it is all right to make a distance 
behind . boat , 
i am with you . ' 
it hides its edges 
in speed , it has 
no edges . plus every time 
he thinks he knows 
straight off , 
direction changes : 
through stunned space the blade 
snaps back , 
turtles into its handle 
and starts over spinning 
the other way . 
all along the chopped-up sidewalk 
( the need to keep 
breaking what we make 
to keep making ) 
the concrete saw 
precise as a skull ; 
the small smoke 
of its own work . 
next to the screen door 
work boots dry in the sun . 
salt lines map the leather 
like the arms of a new-hire 
waiting to punch out . 
the shoe hangs open like the sigh 
of someone too tired to speak 
a mouth that can almost breathe . 
a tear in the leather reveals 
a shiny steel toe 
a glimpse of the promise of safety 
the promise of steel and the years to come . 
i thought of happiness , how it is woven 
out of the silence in the empty house each day 
and how it is not sudden and it is not given 
but is creation itself like the growth of a tree . 
no one has seen it happen , but inside the bark 
no one has heard the root go deeper in the dark , 
but the tree is lifted by this inward work 
and its plumes shine , and its leaves are glittering . 
so happiness is woven out of the peace of hours 
and strikes its roots deep in the house alone : 
white curtains softly and continually blown 
as the free air moves quietly about the room ; 
a shelf of books , a table , and the white-washed wall- 
these are the dear familiar gods of home , 
and here the work of faith can best be done , 
the growing tree is green and musical . 
for what is happiness but growth in peace , 
the timeless sense of time when furniture 
has stood a life 's span in a single place , 
and as the air moves , so the old dreams stir 
the shining leaves of present happiness ? 
no one has heard thought or listened to a mind , 
the air is charged with blessing and does bless ; 
windows look out on mountains and the walls are kind . 
to be poor and raise skinny children . 
to own nothing but skinny clothing . 
skinny food falls in between cracks . 
friends can not visit your skinny home . 
they can not fit through the door . 
the day or the night that you can not 
see with your tiny eyes . 
god sticks you with the smallest pins 
imagine a tiny hole , the other side 
of which is a fat world and how 
lost you would feel . of course , 
i 'm speaking to myself . 
how lost i would feel , and how dangerous . 
a great light is the man who knows the woman he loves 
a great light is the woman who knows the man she loves 
the sleepers and looking hard into the face of each 
and then sends them asleep again with a kiss 
or a whole night of love 
and goes on and on until 
the man and woman who carry the great lights of the 
knowledge of the one lover enter the room 
toward which 
their light is sent and fit the one and the other torch 
that children leap up 
unless the sea swallow them 
in the crossing or hatred or war against which do not 
i 'll see if i can get them for you . 
do you need maps of the mountains and the underworld ? 
we have maps of the mountains but we lack maps of the underworld . 
of course you lack maps of the underworld , 
there are no maps of the underworld . 
i had no intention of going there , or anywhere for that matter . 
it 's just that you asked me if i needed maps . . . . 
yes , yes , it 's my fault , i got carried away . 
what do you need , then , you tell me ? 
pigs , cows , buckets and women . 
women ? 
we have no women . 
you 're a sorry lot , then . 
we are a sorry lot , sir . 
well , i ca n't get you women . 
i assumed as much , sir . 
what are you going to do without women , then ? 
we will suffer , sir . and then we 'll die out one by one . 
can any of you sing ? 
yes , sir , we have many fine singers among us . 
order them to begin singing immediately . 
either women will find you this way or you will die 
with the meaningful tasks you have set for yourselves . 
the moon swells 
and its yellow darkens 
nearer the horizon 
and soon all 
shall appear , orange 
and distinct beside 
the orange sun , 
while the diamond 
flares in its vacuum 
within . it is simple 
to be with the shovel , 
by this divorce , 
it is good 
the luminous 
waits , nice 
convey nothing . 
when i return home to 
coffee at 
7:45 the lithe 
young girls will be going 
to high school , pulling 
to their mouths stark 
cigarettes through 
these last few months 
have been awful , and when 
small farms begin 
to scream like humans 
my heart just lies down , 
a stone . 
i might as well begin by saying how much i like the title . 
it gets me right away because i 'm in a workshop now 
so immediately the poem has my attention , 
that runs through the whole poem 
and tells us that words are food thrown down 
on the ground for other words to eat . 
i can almost taste the tail of the snake 
in its own mouth , 
if you know what i mean . 
but what i 'm not sure about is the voice , 
which sounds in places very casual , very blue jeans , 
like the poem is blowing pipe smoke in my face . 
but maybe that 's just what it wants to do . 
especially the fourth one . 
which gives me a very clear picture . 
just appears out of the blue 
and his fishing pole jigging-i like jigging- 
maybe it 's just me , 
but the next stanza is where i start to have a problem . 
i mean how can the evening bump into the stars ? 
at that point i 'm lost . i need help . 
the other thing that throws me off , 
and maybe this is just me , 
is the way the scene keeps shifting around . 
which makes me think this could be a dream . 
then he takes us into his garden , 
but then i 'm not sure where we 're supposed to be . 
the rain and the mint green light , 
there 's something about death going on here . 
in fact , i start to wonder if what we have here 
is really two poems , or three , or four , 
or possibly none . 
but then there 's that last stanza , my favorite . 
especially the lines spoken in the voice of the mouse . 
but i still love the details he uses 
i start thinking about how hard the mouse had to work 
night after night collecting all these things 
while the people in the house were fast asleep , 
and that gives me a very strong feeling , 
a very powerful sense of something . 
but i do n't know if anyone else was feeling that . 
maybe that was just me . 
maybe that 's just the way i read it . 
no ladders , no descending angels , no voice 
of the veil , or chariot in the sky-only 
water rising and falling in breathing springs 
the fixed and wandering stars : orion rising sideways , 
appearing suddenly over your shoulder , brimming 
rises up and follows . 
the world below the brine , 
forests at the bottom of the sea , the branches and leaves , 
different colors , pale gray and green , purple , white , and gold , the play of light through the water , 
the leaden-eyed shark , the walrus , the turtle , the hairy sea-leopard , and the sting-ray , 
the change thence to the sight here , and to the subtle air breathed by beings like us who walk this sphere , 
the change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres . 
the world had fled , with all its silly cares 
our souls looked down upon a spinning ball . 
the world returned , and this was a surprise 
give us our splendid isolation back . 
when i found out it does n't last for long . 
the world came back and stayed , pain never ended , 
but when the aches and cares begged for a hand , 
grew softer in the light we 'd made and tended , 
i finally began to understand 
love 's widening third stage , and of the three 
as this suburban summer wanders toward dark 
and await miracles . the houses show , through windows 
flashes of knife and fork , the blue light 
between wife and husband in the guest bathroom 
voices sound like echoes in these streets 
that mimic the ancient news of the world 
to girls riding by in the last pieces of light 
-not pen . it 's got 
that same silken 
dust about it , does n't it , 
that same sense of 
onto paper even 
as it was planned . 
it had to be a labor 
of love . it must 've 
taken its author some 
time , some shove . 
i 'll bet it felt good 
in the hand-the o 
if i close my eyes now , i can still see them 
of earth between the huge crack-willow that 
they squat before , hushed , poised to net a frog , 
and the pond the frog will jump to ( it got away ) 
a glass its dive will shatter . 
the unbroken image 
pleases my mind 's eye with its density , 
but a blue burning in the pond 's green glass . 
the grass withered , the tree blew down , earth caught 
the frog , the children grew . sky 's ice-blue flame 
in japan , when you die , they wheel 
and what 's left of your family takes turns 
it looks like they have gathered to dine 
over a dead campfire , but they are not , 
of course , eating you . they are feeding you 
to the round mouth of an urn : 
only in pieces , father , to the fire . 
my daughters spill warm sand over my skin 
as i lie still , watching the sun 
needle the sky . the baby licks her fingers 
to tell , perhaps , if i am ready , her bald head 
of vowels . the older one says nothing 
above the ocean 's slow rush , 
and gone . i 've never been to japan , 
but once , a globe of glass 
found me at the clear end of a wave . 
it drifted from the other side , my mother said . 
with both hands and looked through 
to the green flames of the sun 
before tasting the salt with my tongue . 
when i learned i could own a piece of the world 
as do the soothing neutral tones and classic-contemporary 
to explore with a depth we had n't thought possible . 
it 's not how things are on the world that is mystical , 
whole , a logic and a feeling . what looks like freedom 
is , in fact , the perfection of a plan , and property 
between a thing thought , and done . one can ignore neither 
natural yellow diamonds from south africa no one needs , 
of native companions on the world 's perpetual course . 
the visual field has no limits . and the eye- 
had changed . except , with time , it seems a sort of accident- 
of our circumstances , which hides more than it reveals . 
for what we see could be other than it is . 
whatever we 're able to describe at all could be other 
without intimacy is the cost of privacy , security 
of the endeavour-are largely unseen and likely where the fun is . 
we sit at the captain 's table but do n't know him . he 's italian . 
our parents knew it was n't . the unknown is where we played . 
to the time of year , a paradise of fruits always in season , 
life 's problems will remain untouched . but doubt exists only 
what over the gable-end and high up under tangled cloud 
that raven might be saying to its tumble-soaring mate 
then another in the near field might mean remains beyond 
my ken-being all noise for which no words will manage 
in real time , it was ok , and if it was time in a novel 
there was no peace in the bathroom , none in the china closet 
in short all hell broke loose that wide afternoon . 
by evening all was calm again . a crescent moon 
hung in the sky like a parrot on its perch . 
for night , as usual , knew what it was doing , 
that tomorrow again would surely bring . 
as i gazed at the quiet rubble , one thing 
puzzled me : what had happened , and why ? 
so often it happens that the time we turn around in 
we must reach the shallows before god cuts us free . 
even in a palace , life may be led well ! 
so spake the imperial sage , purest of men , 
of common life , where , crowded up pell-mell , 
our freedom for a little bread we sell , 
match 'd with a palace , is not this a hell ? 
even in a palace ! 
on his truth sincere , 
who spoke these words , no shadow ever came ; 
and when my ill-school 'd spirit is aflame 
when the earth is turned in spring 
the worms are fat as anything . 
and birds come flying all around 
to eat the worms right off the ground . 
they like the worms just as much as i 
like bread and milk and apple pie . 
and once , when i was very young , 
i put a worm right on my tongue . 
i did n't like the taste a bit , 
and so i did n't swallow it . 
because she thinks i ate that worm ! 
under the grass are ignorant , as they eat the earth , 
for their keeping the soil from packing so tight 
that no root , however determined , could pierce it ? 
how the weight of our debt would crush us 
even if they enjoyed keeping the grass alive , 
the garden flowers and vegetables , the clover , 
and wanted nothing that we could give them , 
bright , weightless creatures of cloud , who serve 
an even brighter and lighter master . 
lucky for us they do n't know what they 're doing , 
who eat simply to live , with no more sense of mission 
better save our gratitude for a friend 
who gives us more than we can give in return 
`` if i had nickel , i 'd give it to you , '' 
the lover says , who , having nothing available 
to protect you against your enemies . '' 
for his sake , she 'd wear it , not for her own , 
home across the field at night , the moon above her , 
is a woman 
burying bread 
beneath her lawn . 
praying for summer 
to make whole loaves 
break in their plastic 
shells through dirt 
like so many hands . 
worry is how i thumb 
a groove in the stolen 
jewel case in my back 
pocket at tower 
records , the man 
puts his hands 
on me & amp ; i 'm cooked , 
i 'm crooked , red 
had enough money 
in my pocket 
for music 
& amp ; who really needs 
that bad ? all my father 's 
all my mother 's 
edges worried 
smooth below 
the river of her 
boss 's hands . 
who am i 
who steals music 
who sells drugs 
because i love 
how it sounds . 
who sold my own 
good mouth 
for gold . a man 
puts his hands 
on me & amp ; 
i 'm his & amp ; i 'm paid . 
in the old country 
women buried 
what little we had 
in the dirt & amp ; hoped 
it would make more 
better on earth . 
in this country 
from its plastic 
& amp ; passes clean through us . 
my grandmother 's 
some forgotten dust 
bowl still dark 
why not eat the hand 
that feeds you , i think , 
why not eat the arm , 
the elbow , 
the shoulder ? why 
not eat the whole 
damned body alive 
has never ceased to play ; 
the song the stars of morning sung 
has never died away . 
and prayer is made , and praise is given , 
by all things near and far ; 
and mirrors every star . 
its waves are kneeling on the strand , 
their white locks bowing to the sand , 
they pour their glittering treasures forth , 
their gifts of pearl they bring , 
and all the listening hills of earth 
take up the song they sing . 
the green earth sends its incense up 
from many a mountain shrine ; 
from folded leaf and dewy cup 
she pours her sacred wine . 
rise white as wings of prayer ; 
the altar-curtains of the hills 
are sunset 's purple air . 
the winds with hymns of praise are loud , 
or low with sobs of pain , - 
the thunder-organ of the cloud , 
the dropping tears of rain . 
from all its sunlit leaves . 
the blue sky is the temple 's arch , 
the music of its starry march 
the chorus of a prayer . 
with which her years began , 
and all her signs and voices shame 
an old man bending i come among new faces , 
come tell us old man , as from young men and maidens that love me , 
but soon my fingers fail 'd me , my face droop 'd and i resign 'd myself , 
to sit by the wounded and soothe them , or silently watch the dead ; ) 
years hence of these scenes , of these furious passions , these chances , 
of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us ? 
o maidens and young men i love and that love me , 
soldier alert i arrive after a long march cover 'd with sweat and dust , 
while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on , 
whoever you are , follow without noise and be of strong heart . ) 
bearing the bandages , water and sponge , 
straight and swift to my wounded i go , 
where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in , 
or to the rows of the hospital tent , or under the roof 'd hospital , 
to each and all one after another i draw near , not one do i miss , 
an attendant follows holding a tray , he carries a refuse pail , 
i onward go , i stop , 
yet i think i could not refuse this moment to die for you , if that would save you . 
on , on i go , ( open doors of time ! open hospital doors ! ) 
the crush 'd head i dress , ( poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away , ) 
hard the breathing rattles , quite glazed already the eye , yet life struggles hard , 
in mercy come quickly . ) 
and has not yet look 'd on it . 
i dress a wound in the side , deep , deep , 
but a day or two more , for see the frame all wasted and sinking , 
and the yellow-blue countenance see . 
while the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail . 
i am faithful , i do not give out , 
i sit by the restless all the dark night , some are so young , 
some suffer so much , i recall the experience sweet and sad , 
( many a soldier 's loving arms about this neck have cross 'd and rested , 
many a soldier 's kiss dwells on these bearded lips . ) 
the shock comes slowly 
first you hear the words 
and they are like all other words , 
ordinary , breathing out of lips , 
moving toward you in a straight line . 
later they shatter 
something else hidden in the muscles 
of the face , something the throat wanted to say . 
so every syllable becomes a sore . 
a special scarf has to be worn to conceal it . 
it is now the size of a head . 
the next time you look , 
it has grown two eyes and a mouth . 
it is difficult to know which to use . 
now you are seeing everything twice . 
after a while it becomes an old friend . 
it reminds you every day of how it came to be . 
because of the first , the fear of wreck , 
which they taught us to fear ( though we learned 
at once , and easily ) , 
because of the wreck 
and heft to assure it ) - 
rise above 
steeple that took the eye straight up to 
the cross-beam of that cross , torn blue 
rise above 
plane , the vertical direction of virtue ( a bony 
finger pointing up to where matter dissolves 
the space program , expensive 
the planet 's crust at anything out there , pocked 
moon , red rocky mars , 
ever the upward 
, carved in the marble arch of the old library 
door under which generations passed , 
hoping to rise above it all- 
over the table , her body floating an unlikely 
watch her hovering , weightless , 
the crowd staring 
in wonder , the trick of the thing still hidden , 
and the magician doing something now 
silk in the air , as she floats 
the magician 
still waving his scarves , the air a bright 
shatter of wings , doves from a hat , 
our disbelief suspended , 
beneath our notice as we ride 
above it all , like froth on a wave 
soon , when the tide turns . 
my life lay crumpled like a smashed car . 
lines gather at mouth and at eyes 
under the clear wave , the sun shining . 
stands north of the shed : spiders 
it knows it is going to die . 
a stone , the closed eye of the dirt . 
outside before dawn 
houses sail up 
a door clicks ; a light opens . 
if the world is a dream , 
and the rich in connecticut are dreamers . 
who live in shacks made of oil cans 
and broken doors , who stitch their shirts 
until the cloth disappears under stitches , 
who collect nails in ball jars . 
the tracks laid through an acre of wheat stubble , 
and cross the field into the new pine . 
there 's a truth limits man 
the world is changing 
the world knows it 's changing 
heavy is the sorrow of the day 
the old have the look of doom 
the young mistake their fate in that look 
that is truth 
but it is n't all truth 
life has meaning 
and i do not know the meaning 
even when i felt it were meaningless 
i hoped and prayed and sought a meaning 
death proved meaningless without life 
yes the world is changing 
but death remains the same 
it takes man away from life 
the only meaning he knows 
and usually it is a sad business 
this death 
i am able able 
because i want to know the meaning of everything 
death and god 
hard hard it 's hard 
i learned life were no dream 
i learned truth deceived 
man is not god 
life is a century 
death an instant 
but prayer was not enough , after all , for my father . 
his last two brothers died five weeks apart . 
he could n't get to sleep , had no appetite , sat 
staring . though he prayed , 
he could find no peace until he tried 
to write about his brothers , tell a story 
he bears down-harvey loved his children . 
i discovered those few sheets of paper 
as i looked through my father 's old bible 
on the morning of his funeral . the others 
in the family had seen them long ago ; 
they had all known the story , 
and they told me i had not , most probably , because 
i am a writer , 
and my father was embarrassed by his effort . yet 
who has seen him as i can : risen 
in the middle of the night , bending over 
the paper , working close 
to the heart of all greatness , he is so lost . 
after the gossip one returns to grammar . 
almost to say that speech 
for what we own .

if not for his lust , his sickness to chase , to claim her ; 
if not for that native woman 's quick intelligence , out-climbing 
i imagined the atmosphere would be clear , 
many have pictured a river here , 
but no one mentioned all the boats , 
their benches crowded with naked passengers , 
i knew i would not always be a child 
with a model train and a model tunnel , 
and i knew i would not live forever , 
jumping all day through the hoop of myself . 
i had heard about the journey to the other side 
in the leather purse of the man holding the oar , 
but how could anyone have guessed 
that as soon as we arrived 
we would be asked to describe this place 
and to include as much detail as possible- 
not just the water , he insists , 
iron , ankle-shredding shackles- 
our thoughts and feelings about being dead , 
think of it more as an exercise , he groans , 
think of writing as a process ,

i was born across the river where i 
it please you , through no fault of my own , 
i gave birth , i gave blessing , i gave rise to suspicion . 
air drifting like spirits and old windows . 
i was an index of first lines when i was born . 
i was born waist-deep stubborn in the water crying 
ai n't i a woman and a brother i was born 
to this hall of mirrors , this horror story i was 
by mosquitoes and thieves , i was born passing 
i read minds before i could read fishes and loaves ; 
i walked a piece of the way alone before i was born . 
nor yet so ugly half can be 
as is the inward suspicious mind . 
o friend ! i know not which way i must look 
or groom ! - we must run glittering like a brook 
no grandeur now in nature or in book 
plain living and high thinking are no more : 
is gone ; our peace , our fearful innocence , 
and pure religion breathing household laws . 
just what i needed , 
just when i understood i was no longer among 
suddenly come phone calls , messages sift out of the air 
to ask who will be there : 
names i have n't given a thought to in a score 
( a score ! ) of years , and names i used to think about but do n't much anymore , 
and those i think of all the time and yet 
have lost somehow like keys to doors i 've closed , and some i have tried to forget- 
and some who will never arrive at this date 
here in the distant future where we wait 
still surprised at how 
heartbreak , looked at through the wrong end of distance 's glasses , 
the way we wept because it was unjust . 
why should we travel back , who 've come so far- 
we know who we are . 
how can we be the same 
as those quaint ancestors we have left behind , who share our name- 
nothing proved can be , 
the boys were out 
in force 
-and full moon 
bouncing back 
and forth that 
above the bars 
last night 
it burned 
thru old 
gray paper 
tonight it 
or drive-in sci-fi 
i 've been 
long enough 
even the moon 
wears a ring 
and is full 
sailed off in a wooden shoe -- 
sailed on a river of crystal light , 
into a sea of dew . 
`` where are you going , and what do you wish ? '' 
the old moon asked of the three . 
that live in this beautiful sea ; 
nets of silver and gold have we ! '' 
and nod . 
the old moon laughed and sang a song , 
as they rocked in the wooden shoe , 
and the wind that sped them all night long 
ruffled the waves of dew . 
that lived in that beautiful sea -- 
`` now cast your nets wherever you wish -- 
so cried the stars to the fishermen three : 
and nod . 
all night long their nets they threw 
then down from the skies came the wooden shoe , 
bringing the fishermen home ; 
't was all so pretty a sail it seemed 
as if it could not be , 
and some folks thought 't was a dream they 'd dreamed 
of sailing that beautiful sea -- - 
but i shall name you the fishermen three : 
and nod . 
and nod is a little head , 
and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies 
so shut your eyes while mother sings 
of wonderful sights that be , 
and you shall see the beautiful things 
as you rock in the misty sea , 
where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three : 
and nod . 
( she opens the door ) 
( he is twelve inches 
away ) her fingers 
still splayed across the 
battened-down brass latch

is eight feet away ) 
is twenty-eight feet 
away ) ( she opens 
the door ) the black air 
is fast flowing and 
cold ( she closes the 
thin intimacy 
tight under her chin 
( he is forty feet 
away ) the stiff wind 
his scent from her hair 
from the numb fingers 
she raises to her 
mouth a cab pulls up 
( she opens the door ) 
she bends the body 
( she closes the door ) 
the cracked brown vinyl 
away ) biting the 
backs of her thighs red

please stop she says ( he 
is four hundred feet 
away ) please stop the

door ) the cab stops she

up seeking men like the father they barely saw unless they went 
to his studio to be painted which was n't ok with their mothers 
who were not only jealous but guilty of giving birth to girls 
& amp ; would soon suffer at the hands of other monsters with x- 
from sitting at desks & amp ; being daughters & amp ; lovers of beasts . 
still there will be your desire , and hers , and his hopes and theirs , 
your laughter , their laughter , 
your curse and his curse , her reward and their reward , their dismay and his dismay and her dismay and yours- 
and this world 's goods th'accommodations be . 
our life is nothing but a winter 's day ; 
some only break their fast , and so away . 
others stay dinner , and depart full fed . 
he 's most in debt that lingers out the day ; 
he hooked to the body hard 
took it well 
and loved to fight 
had seven in a row and a small fleck 
over one eye , 
with arms thin as wires- 
it was a good one , 
the safe lions roared and threw money ; 
they were both up and down many times , 
but he lost that one 
in which neither of them fought at all , 
and now he 's over at mike 's 
the fleck over the eye 
still young , 
but you do n't ask him , 
you do n't ask him anything 
except maybe 
you think it 's going to rain ? 
you think the sun 's gon na come out ? 
to which he 'll usually answer 
hell no , 
but you 'll have your important tank of gas 
and drive off . 
mornings , the body 's old 
to a million hives- 
as it swallows its strange light and gleams 
from within as if reborn 
when the bees come . 
that whilst he breathed he would drink no more ; 
but since , i know his meaning , for i think 
he meant he would not breath whilst he did drink . 
china is made of earth , of sun-dried mud . 
in this part of china everything is made from the earth : 
the houses , the walls around cities , and villages , 
the tombs scattered over the countryside . 
even the people . 
there are hills below that appear to be piles of mud 
set out to dry in the sun , naked , 
without a single tree or bush . 
they crowd around the landscape 
sometimes we fly so low that we almost touch them . 
and then i notice that the wind has brushed 
some kind of pattern into the earth : a mysterious alphabet 
written in the mud , 
struggling to communicate something precise . 
but there is not a single animal 
or human being in the yellow desert below . 
not a single village . 
where chinese civilization was born , 
in the cradle of the yellow river . 
in front of the terminal , 
three children are playing with a lump of earth : 
they are bundled up in jackets 
i join them in their game 
until a young woman comes out of the terminal 
to call me in for dinner . 
to keep me from leaving . 
so do the other two , clinging to me , 
asking me not to go . 
the young woman comes out again , 
one of them calls to me as i turn away : 
come back soon ! 
gives me a present : a pebble , 
a precious gift . 
in this part of china there are no stones . 
i put the pebble in my pocket , 
to take back home , to show what a precious gift 
i was given by a little chinese girl : a pebble 
from the cradle of chinese civilization . 
a civilization made of earth , 
a civilization without bones , 
without a skeleton for support . 
dissolving into thousands of separate gestures , 
thousands of different shades . and then just as suddenly 
which makes china such an exquisite thing . 
everything is reflected : 
an unimaginable number of movements , 
of patterns , thoughts , images , 
here are the four elements out of which china is made : 
earth , wood , porcelain , silk . 
i should add a fifth element : poetry , 
when the living rot on the bodies of the dead 
when the sun itself has no other purpose than being a shroud 
the human tide moves on . . . 
its timeless light can stain ; 
the worm that brings man 's flesh to dust 
more gold than gold the love i sing , 
men say the passions should grow old 
with waning years ; my heart 
't is my immortal part : 
nor is there any god can lay 
on love the finger of decay . 
out out of its borders pain has a leash on its neck 
out out of time there is spring 's shattered hope 
you will find it exactly the thing : 
it will carry and fetch , you can ride on its back , 
or lead it about with a string . 
( a desolate region of snow ) 
has for centuries made it a nursery pet , 
he will buy you the creature-or else he will not . 
the potato that ate all its carrots , 
can see in the dark like a mole , 
its eyes the scars 
because it hates the light , 
a-riding on a pony ; 
stuck a feather in his hat 
`` there is no object so foul that intense light will not make 
beautiful . '' 
weighted and warped like them , unable 
to hold much more than glasses and rags . 
for space with magazines they stole 
from garbage bins behind our street ; 
each shoe reveals a run-down sole . 
almost always with empty hands . 
so rubber , glass , and metal glint- 
and for a moment make you squint- 
you 'll see our neighbors bathed in gold 
as if their worth can not be sold . 
i was born 
i split from my parallel self i split from 
the girl i also could have been 
& amp ; her name / easy / i know the story 
all her life / my mother wanted 
a girl named for a flower 
our mothers / 
petals wrung 
for their perfume 
i was planted 
land became ocean became land anew 
its shape refusing root in my fallow mouth 
& amp ; my name / taken from a dead woman 
cut jasmine in a bowl 
our longing 
our mothers ' 
garlands hanging from our necks 
how can ye chant , ye little birds , 
that sings upon the bough ; 
thou minds me o ' the happy days , 
that sings beside thy mate ; 
to see the wood-bine twine , 
it was winter . the opposite of burning , 
which is also burning . 
a cup of wine , a worm eating its opposite head . 
the extra light of spring threw our business 
its stone . war would soon come but not 
then a crime in our community led to anger . 
gossip gathered the truth into a ball ; 
from the yellow light of the barn . 
we heard his sobs coming from the orchard , 
and these were a source of comfort . 
though a vinegar taste kept the air difficult . 
we would know it by the rocks in our hands . 
autumn was just my luck . i could not stomach 
the broth i boiled , and slept badly . 
arguments i won in my head lost direction 
but quietly now , indoors . 
were too many for anything less than a lake . 
in the yellow light of the barn we tried to write 
sentences each other would like , or not desire 
the wolf taking scent , water moving quickly , 
the sign of the errant cloud and alphabet , 
its opposite head , only this time surrounded 
by snow , which has n't stopped falling since 
thursday , the name we gave to our child . 
i ask your doctor 
read williams he cured 
sick babies i tell her and 
and all she 's looking at the wall 
now the floor now your chart 
now the door never 
heard of him she says 
but i ca n't stop explaining 
how important this is 
i need to know your doctor 
to endure i 'm past his heart 
attack his strokes and now as if 
i ca n't remember the date 
he died or even 
the year of what now 
does that even mean pure is n't it 
obvious we are each our own culture 
alive with the virus that 's waiting 
because they are 
fleeing the trees , who are cruel to one another , 
a mixed bag 
the flags do n't give any shade at all . 
we build into . 
you hear your own accent- 
a child makes an error to see if you 're listening . 
a cough muffled 
in the next throat : 
a family of coughs comes 
to couch in us 
while the sun rises 
over the church , 
the ground 
the fingers lie in the lap , 
separate , lonely , as in the field 
the separate blades of grass 
-for j.p.o . 
i have wished you dead and myself dead , 
how could it be otherwise . 
and you 've set your dogs on me . 
you have been a hurricane to me 
and a pile of broken sticks 
a child could kick . 
for the exercise and the view , 
strong and warm , that summer wind . 
such were they , a dumb stuffed thing 
to say , if truth is we all grow old un- 
a flight , where does dark begin settling 
my little bones . i dream and do love 
to have them , blue fish 
in a lake , my head more tipped up than down 
under damp earth . some days others like deer 
from the shot , peeled back , how i 
find trees dressed in wild 
of heaven , put up , the years come and reaching 
their long wet hands . 
nothing required an account of me 
and still i did n't give one . 
they got me into the sunday-school 
in spoon river 
i could have been no worse off 
with a blow of his fist . 
and no children shall worship at my grave . 
if light pours like water 
into the kitchen where i sway 
with my tired children , 
if the rug beneath us 
is woven with tough flowers , 
and the yellow bowl on the table 
rests with the sweet heft 
of fruit , the sun-warmed plums , 
if my body curves over the babies , 
and if i am singing , 
then loneliness has lost its shape , 
and this quiet is only quiet . 
girl set down among the wrung-out hides . 
a girl who was coming from church . it is late 
destiny or bad luck we should fear ? weak heart 
thousands crush past her without pausing 
days ? to forget the yellow dress ? 
i am waiting for her mother to find her , still 
her fingers just curling like petals of a fallen flower 
and how did it end ? let someone have gathered her up 
before the stars assembled coldly overhead : 
her face covered like the bride of a god ; let them 
veiled with a stranger 's handkerchief . 
part of the difference between floating and going down . 
and a god i can swallow : 
under ice . 
and some voice . 
weary fears , the 
a yellow leaf in the branches 
in the front yard ; 
i see it , a yellow leaf 
among so many . 
nothing striking , striped , stripped , 
more than its yellow 
on this day , 
which is enough , which makes me 
think of it later in the day , 
remember it in conversation 
with a friend , 
though i do not mention it- 
on a clear day 
a january like so many . 
to the nests in back of the garage , 
then blackened . ashes fell , 
into the sweaty face of my father , 
but most too stunned , 
of a dance , flailing in the smoke . 
when one landed on my arm , i stiffened . 
his wings settled into a still gauze , 
body coiled in yellow bands , 
every step , careful , quivering , as if neither 
of us knew who was supposed to sting . 
the war was over . 
buried the dead , sat at the bar 
with the enemy , near the blue 
etched clouds from oysters , 
as they rose snowing pearls . 
which hovered above 
our heads . 
with the world 's smallest blade 
i am done smoking cigarettes , done waiting tables , done counting tips 
at two a.m. in the neon-dark dance hall , done sleeping with young men 
in my apartment , done facing them or not , thinking of oblivion , which 
is better than nothing . i am done not wearing underwear because 
on a pool table , all those balls piled up in the pockets . i am done . 
i am never going back . when i see that night on the street i will 
nodding in your workshop . i am done teaching english as a second 
language , saying i pointing to my chest , saying you pointing to them . 
i am done teaching the poetry class where no one talked and no one 
its sun-white leaves in the breeze as if to say , i give up , i give up . i am done 
on her body . i am done with the wide afternoons of before , the long 
stare , the tightly closed door . and i am done , too , for the most part , 
to see if that will make the baby sleep another fifteen minutes 
so i can finish this poem . i am done thinking of the past as if it had 
survived , though sometimes i think of the past and sometimes i see it 
yes , i live inside the piano , 
but there is no need for you 
to come and visit me . 
yesterday , the sunshine made the air glow 
pushing me like a sixteen-year-old 
to toss my shirt off , and run along the river shore , 
and i believed , 
more than believed , 
the air beneath trees was female blue dancers 
i approached , and there in the dry leaves , in the crisp twigs , 
i turned softly as if dancing with a blue woman made of air , 
sunlight , 
in shrub-weed skirts . 
i knew the dance that would please the gods , 
i knew the dance that would make the river water 
i knew the dance steps that praised my ancestors . 
yeah , i wanted to write you a poem woman 
for two days , 
refuge beneath the russian olive trees 
came close to me 
its female love went the other way 
that 's what i saw , 
the male fly before the hunter 's rifles , circle in sights of hunters 
and take the shots , the roaring rifle blast 
after blast 
and circle beyond over the fields to meet its female companion . 
that 's how i miss you , that 's how i wanted to write you a poem 
since we left 
you one way 
me another way . i was the male 
taking with me the hunters that would harm you 
so you could escape , 
that kind of poem 
i am writing you now . 
circling as hunters aim down on me 
while you rise , rise , rise into the blue sky 
and meet me over in the next fields . 
i wanted to write you a poem for two days now 
to tell you how happy i was , 
seeing a white crane arc 
like an awkward nine-year-old kid 
much taller than the others his age 
flapping down the basketball court . 
but once the white crane 
than a ballet dancer 's leap across air , 
all of its feathers ballet dancer 's toes , 
all of its feathers delicate dancers 
all of its feathers , in motion 
made me believe in myself , 
but more , 
made me think of the curve of your spine , 
how i traced my finger down your spine 
when you slept , 
your spine 
toward the sunshine , 
and my hands my face my torso and chest and legs and hips 
put a sun in sunday , sunday .

memory is 
below the surface 
an eternal city 
a heap of rubble 
debris smaller 
than your fist 
an animal with- 
out a leash 
organized wreck- 
age ghost net 
or one hanging 
silence on the phone- 
she 's gone , my sister said , 
and we wept and wept 
over my grandmother 
while my sister sat 
with her body and me 
they sent told her to recite psalms 
as comfort so we listened to each other 
breathe instead and my sister 's breath was 
a tunnel a handful of pebbles a knotted 
chinese jump-rope her breath was the coiled 
in her oven o memory how much you 
erased how many holes we punched 
in your facts since who knows the stories 
no marked graves just too much food on 
of ships and the motion of some 
suspension bridges o memory 
the surface and some above 
like the fact that i ca n't 
shake the december 
my sister 's red hair 
caught fire from 
leaning too close 
candles , our 
putting her 
out with a 
dish towel 
with her 
arms . 
is a letter i read and put away , a daily reminder 
at this distance . 
like a painting , our talk is dense with description , 
or is that only how it seems now , looking back ? 
long ago , this desert was an inland sea . in the mountains 
you can still find shells . 
toe-and-finger holes along the three hundred and fifty-seven foot 
of the dead hovers about its earthly home 
four days , before the prayer sticks drive it away . 
today all good jews collect their crimes like old clothes 
to be washed and given to the poor . 
i remember how my father held his father around the shoulders 
as they walked to the old synagogue in philadelphia . 
`` we 're almost there , pop , '' he said . `` a few more blocks . '' 
i want to tell you that we , too , are almost there , 
october brooding in me , will open to reveal 
our names-inscribed or absent - 
that 's right , i 'm talking to you , 
not him or her . 
for a security check . 
it has nothing to do with you , 
your physical features , or your name . 
do you now belong 
or have you ever belonged 
do you have weapons training ? 
have you ever visited a training camp ? 
did you pack your own bags ? 
you people send your sons and daughters 
you animals , you ! 
if you will please step aside . 
if you will please remove your shoes . 
if you will please come with me . 
if you will please not harm us . 
may you live in interesting times . 
as americans , you know exactly 
what i 'm talking about . 
as americans , you may be subject to this . 
as americans , you should be worried . 
is it you who are to blame ? 
we can not help you . 
there is nothing we can do for you . 
at your father 's house . 
they wanted to ask you questions . 
i heard about you 
found not guilty . 
there 's no sense in you 
making a fuss- 
they let you go free , did n't they ? 
once you begin to see you 
differently , as separate 
from you , wholly other 
from you , 
then you can become like us . 
what has history made of you ? 
let 's get to the point : 
it was always 
like looking in the mirror- 
that face is you . i am you . 
sometimes in our sleep we touch 
the body of another woman 
and we wake up 
and we know the first nights 
with summer visitors 
whatever we remember , 
the darkest hair being brushed 
in front of the darkest mirror 
in the darkest room . 
you 'd think the sky would run out of water , 
but it wo n't ; it just keeps coming down . i need someone 
to marvel at the breath escaping from me . 
does someone think of you and turn the channel ? 
how would you ever know ? 
i 'm certain of something i 'd prefer not to tell you about . 
`` slow down , '' you say . but i can already see my breath , 
and its only october . walking with you is making everything 
where i have sex and people are all like , 
`` he 's amazing , we really like his sex style ! '' 
the audience how wonderful i was in my best moments ; 
of everything but how to stop ? i promise i 'll make this up to 
you . i 'll write your name on the menu board , 
on the tongue , he loves me 
at a distance , black polished stone 
skipping the lake that swallows 
worn-down words , a kind of drown 
through the center of small 
town ; the current 's brown and 
with recent torrents ) , silt rushing 
passes by too close ( i have to jump ) 
and yes i do hear music here . it 's blue , or 
himself to voice ) , his fingers 
between the pages of a book , 
spring , when he walks into the house 
he has wings . song is a temporary thing 
( attempt ) , he wants to own his music . 
who should have mercy on a wanderer 
if not the creator ? you are the judge 
and i the guilty who should have mercy 
on the guilty if not the judge ? you are all 
and i am a particle . who should have mercy 
on a particle if not the all ? 
you are the living one and i am dead . 
who should have mercy on the dead if not 
and i am clay . who should have mercy on clay 
and i am straw who should have mercy on straw 
and i am the reader . who should have mercy 
are the beginning and i am what follows . 
who should have mercy on what follows 
if not the beginning ? you are the end and i am 
what follows . who should have mercy 
on what follows if not the end ? 
they did the deed of darkness 
in their own mid-light . 
he plucked a gray field mouse 
suddenly in the wind . 
the small dead fly alive 
his cold pride , helpless . 
all she receives is life . 
they are terrified . they touch . 
life is too much . 
then her small falcon , gone . 
will not rise here again . 
smaller than she , he goes 
claw beneath claw beneath 
needles and leaning boughs , 
tall as my love for you , 
i love you in mid-air , 
i love myself the ground . 
the great wings sing nothing 
lightly . lightly fall . 
you and your whole race . 
look down upon the town in which you live 
and be ashamed . 
look down upon white folks 
and upon yourselves 
and be ashamed 
that such stupid ignorance breeds children there 
that you yourselves have not the sense to care 
nor the manhood to stand up and say 
i dare you to come one step nearer , evil world , 
with your hands of greed seeking to touch my throat , i dare you to come one step nearer me : 
when you can say that 
you will be free ! 
you are afraid of the dark , 
for which you blame the raccoons , 
or more to the point , your father , 
who took you and your mother 
into the night with a flashlight 
and shotgun , then left 
with both , while you held 
her shaking hand . you 
would follow your father 
to the end of the world , 
those distant birch woods 
where raccoons rustle 
and flash their green eyes . 
his gun was firing 
into the persimmon trees 
and the rain of leaves and ripe fruit 
fell farther and farther , 
until only the crackle 
of the hounds could be heard . 
the raccoons came then 
to hiss all around : 
he left you , he left you , 
and now you are ours . 
for the drowning , yes , there is always panic . 
alone . crossing out wonder . crossing out 
a need to know . you only feel you need to live . 
that you deserve it . even here . even as your chest 
fills with a strange new air , you will not ask 
what this means . like prey caught in the wolf 's teeth , 
but you are not the lamb . you are what 's in the lamb 
that keeps it kicking . let it . 
i want to spend a lot but not all of my years with you . 
we 'll talk about kids 
but make plans to travel . 
i will remember your eyes 
as green when they were gray . 
our dogs will be named for now and mostly . 
sex will be good but next door 's will sound better . 
there will be small things . 
i will pick up your damp towel from the bed , 
and then i wo n't . 
i wo n't be as hot as i was 
when i was n't yours 
when we pull up alongside a cattle car 
i will silently judge you 
you will bring me wine 
and notice how much i drink . 
the garden you plant and i plant 
the vowels 
we speak are n't vows , 
but there 's something 
holding me here , for now , 
like your eyes , which i suppose 
are brown , after all . 
you ask me , why , tho ' ill at ease , 
and languish for the purple seas . 
that sober-suited freedom chose , 
a man may speak the thing he will ; 
a land of settled government , 
but by degrees to fullness wrought , 
hath time and space to work and spread . 
when single thought is civil crime , 
and individual freedom mute ; 
tho ' power should make from land to land 
tho ' every channel of the state 
should fill and choke with golden sand- 
wild wind ! i seek a warmer sky , 
and i will see before i die 
the palms and temples of the south . 
you ca n't even buy a soda . you can only 
see these things , see a mother steer 
her son to the car , his head cocked 
licking his ice cream . 
earlier , driving , trying to keep 
between two cornfields , i could n't see myself 
into a map , could n't be anywhere in it , 
though i knew all the patient states 
between us . 
close to each other , but looking at them 
you would n't know it . would you . 
sit on the park bench and chew this mint leaf . 
right now , way above your head , two men 
red . watching you chew your mint , the men 
their fingers , numb from lack of gravity . 
they see you and , for the first time since 
they were gentle . and smart . one could 
in half . one wrote tales of sailors who 
whales for islands . does it matter which 
man is which ? they just quit their mission 
for you . they 're on their way down . you 'll 
take both men - a winter husband and 
a summer husband . does it matter which 
so much work to do before - wait you 're going 
this world is already willing 
to give you anything do you want to know latin 
okay now everyone 
summer children will barely hurt dear i 'm hurt that you would ever think 
i do n't glisten to you i 'm always glistening 
tame your voice and turn around 
the click click click 
are n't you known are n't you 
known here 
how can you be certain that anywhere else will provide 
more pears than you could ever eat 
remember the sweet rot of it all 
come back you forgot your sweater 
what if there 's nothing there when you - 
you do n't have your 
what if it 's cold 
1 . 
a man can stand with both feet touching 
the ground until his legs no longer reach 
that far , until the ground disappears . 
2 . 
in japan . it does n't matter how tall you are . 
3 . 
a man can hold a woman , ca n't stand to lose 
her to the heart 's wreckage . his body will fall 
4 . 
when he lifts you over his head , you will be 
eight and a half feet above the ground . 
5 . 
a man can stand for anything when seen 
from below-fatherhood , majesty , satisfaction 
after conquest . in the end all men are seen 
6 . 
looks so small from the sky . 
7 . 
a man and a woman can wrestle together 
in the same bed . a man and a woman 
8 . 
heartbeat , war drum , earthquake . just listen . 
9 . 
a man can stand naked in a foreign country , 
can search for meaning in strange tongues . he tries 
about giants . it does n't matter where he stands . 
10 . 
to look at your house from new angles , 
when you think of how your father died , 
the giant will be there to catch you . 
my daughter says . unless the car could float . 
unless by car you mean boat . unless the ocean 
turned to ice and promised not to crack . 
having lifted its anchor . unless we could row 
our country there . our whole continent 
would have to come along , would n't it ? unless 
we cut ourselves free . what kind of saw 
could we use for that ? what kind of oars 
could deliver one country to another ? 
promised nothing but ice ? who would cut 
her home to pieces and row away for that ? 
you could pick it up by the loose flap of a roof 
and all the houses would come up together 
white cubes , olive trees , flowers 
dangling from your hand 
a few donkey hooves might stick out 
flailing the air for balance , 
and no children would fall . 
even though it is small , 
the people are greek , and it sits 
still it is tough , it reminds you 
drawn up in circles by night 
you could swing it around your head 
and still nothing would happen , 
it would stay 
solid , the white walls 
rising up out of the sea 
for twenty-six hundred years 
it has endured everything , but now 
we who have forgotten everything , 
we whose homes have all gone 
the spider web with sticky fingers 
tighter and tighter it is wound 
till the young men can not stand it , 
they pack up and leave town 
the sky is full of children 
with wild eyes and huge faces 
falling to the ground . 
in the bear bar 's back bar 
that 's what the first line says 
of the song i 've been playing all summer 
at the keyboard-trying to get my hands 
around its dark , melancholy chords , 
its story line of a melody that twists 
that i 've also been trying to learn , though 
come to think of it , neither am i much 
when it comes to love-no great shakes , i mean . 
not that i have n't had my chances . 
twenty years married , i made a lousy husband , 
half asleep , selfish , more like a big baby 
doing anything for anybody but me . 
`` now and then he took his thumb 
that 's what i imagined my ex-wife said 
`` it 's all about bill . '' she was right . 
how , at our wedding , our poet friends 
read poems of ( mostly ) utter depression 
to salute us . i wondered if their griefs in love 
had double-crossed our union , if strange 
on your wedding day , if i 'm not 
doing the same damned thing . . . . 
i have n't come to spring up and put my curse 
on your bliss . here 's what i want to say : 
you 're young . you do n't know what love is . 
and as the next line of the song goes , you wo n't 
- '' until you know the meaning of the blues . '' 
often , i hope ) to raise their fiery swords 
against your paradise . a little of that 
and you could n't be married outside under 
you 've kicked each other out of it 
of course ) , teach yourself how to say 
a few kind words to each other . 
do n't stand there angry , stony . 
each of you let the other know 
what you are feeling and thinking 
and then it may be possible 
to return to each other smiling , 
hand in hand . for arm in arm , 
you are your best eden . remember 
the advice the old poet sang to you 
the day you got married . 
may you enjoy a good laugh 
thinking of him and his silver thumb 
now that you 've turned the key 
into your new life in the beautiful 
massachusetts rain and-hey , now-sun ! 
i sang my songs so much 
that they became 
the melody of my moods , 
a room i lived in , 
and a balm for my wounds . 
i sang my songs enough 
to know them backward 
and forward , enough 
to wonder if they could lift me 
to center stage . 
i 'd sung my songs enough 
to think i could take on 
baltimore 's best talent 
at the harlem theatre 
and maybe even win . 
if you sing a song enough , 
it can go to your head that way . 
would never cross the border 
left great houses standing on main street . 
through sleepy hollow cemetery 
stamped with the word henry 
we remembered henry 's night in jail , 
refusing tax for the mexican war , 
and i could see you hunched with him , 
the perpetual wink of your eye 
lost after the windshield 
to ask what you and henry 
were doing in there , you would say : 
you got a song , man , sing it . 
you got a bell , man , ring it . 
you hear the sun in the morning 
through closed shutters . as you sleep 
the early sky is colored 
in fish scales , and you open your eyes 
like a street 
already lined with fruit . 
listen , you 
who transformed your anguish 
put your voice 
where your memory is . 
you who swallowed 
the afternoon dust , 
defend everything you understand 
with words . 
you , if no one else , 
you , who saw the images 
of disgust growing , 
will understand how time 
you , who gave yourself 
know better than anyone 
why you turned your back 
do n't hush , 
do n't throw away 
the most persistent truth , 
sometimes do . 
remember well 
and slick mud 
flimsy windows the wind 
kept rattling 
in winter , and that 
up in your clothes . 
tell how you were able to come 
history 's doors 
to see your early years , 
your people , the others . 
name the way 
and how you came 
of that teacher , 
in your dusk eyes . 
red mouth ; flower soft , 
your soul leaps up-and flashes 
star-like , white , flame-hot . 
you ! stirring the depths of passionate desire ! 
a heavenly father would suffice 
had he the offer of - 
you left me boundaries of pain - 
between eternity and time - 
your consciousness - and me - 
dirt on my chin and i wonder : am i already 
in the ground ? like a toy turned real , i can not shed 
the sense that i have died . the german word 
for heaven 's the same 
as the german word for sky . on hearing a cruel 
prince was in danger , i prayed for him to thrive , 
sure to end up buried 
i ruined you 
, and though he did , the joke 's 
on him : he ruined me only for this world , 
and this world is not long 
for itself . the earth , that ever-loving 
pocket money when it dies , never the land - 
a dream , these days . to work at home is a privilege , i remind myself . 
this notebook is so old the paper is yellow . 
i wonder where the tree grew . 
seems like you never get one thing without losing another . 
there 's some sort of law about that 
how much my life has cost the earth , 
how many people have died that i might live . 
start with my parents , and theirs , and all who died 
because of them . it 's like we drip in blood . 
who can wake up then tomorrow morning , 
do the tasks set out before them 
as if it was their work and their work only ? 
who has the courage to look out to the east again 
at someone else 's sun ? 
hard dreams . the moment at which you recognize that your own death lies 
rain is not safe to drink . 
hand outlined in paint on a brick wall . storm turns playground into a 
swamp . finally we spot the wood duck on the middle lake . 
sun swells in the morning sky . 
table to the next , seeking distance from the cold january air out the coffee 
outside , a dog is tied to any empty bench , bike chained to the no parking 
sign . 
dawn in the bare birch trees , the sun , swollen , throbs over the horizon . hotel 
one can hear the electricity wired in the walls , water rushing through the 
pipes , the boards and joints of the old house groaning as they settle . 
mouse . 
waste deep in the big muddy . the sound of rain around . the line ( not visible ) 
binds letters into words . people are drowning . 
moon , broken in the middle . what a watch watches . song of the single en- 
blades of grass brittle in the freeze . spider 's corner of the bath room . one 
maple tree that will not return to life . 
people , do n't ask me again where my shoes are . 
the valley i walked through was frozen to me 
talisman-i 'm fine , people . do n't stare 
at my feet . and do n't flash the sign of the cross 
in my face . i carry the blue cross card- 
card among cards , card of my number 
and gold seal . so shall ye know i am of 
the system , in the beast 's belly and up 
to here , people , with your pity . 
people , what is wrong with you ? i do n't care 
what the sign on your door says . i will go 
to another door . i will knock and rattle 
and if you wo n't , then surely someone , somewhere , 
of the blooming stump , i bend over you , taste you , 
keep an eye on you , dream for you the beginning 
of what you may one day dream an end to . 
the new century peeled me bone-bare 
like a first song inside a warbler-that bird , people , 
who knows not to go where the sky 's stopped . 
keep this in mind . do you think 
the fox wo n't find your nest ? that 
the egg of you will endure the famine ? 
you , you people born of moons with no 
mother-planets , you who are back-lit , 
who have no fathers in heaven , hear now 
the bruise-knuckled knock of me . i am returned . 
from your alley . from your car up on blocks . 
dare you trust any longer the chained-up dogs of hell 
do not confuse me with dawn . 
now people , about the shoes : the shoes 
have no doubt entered the sea 
i may be a false prophet , but god bless me , at least 
i have something to say . i lay myself down 
but the marks already forming in the lead . 
you smiled , you spoke , and i believed , 
by every word and smile deceived . 
another man would hope no more ; 
nor hope i what i hoped before : 
but let not this last wish be vain ; 
deceive , deceive me once again ! 
you that i loved all my life long , 
you are not the one . 
you that i followed , my line or path or way , 
that i followed singing , and you 
earth and air of the world the way went through , 
and you who stood around it so it could be 
the way , you forests and cities , 
and observed me , your bald dog barking , 
as i stumbled past in a hurry along my line , 
you are not the one . but you 
are the one , you that i loved all my life long , 
you i still love so in my dying mind 
i grasp me loving you when we are gone . 
you are the one , you path or way or line 
that winds beside the house where she and i live on , 
still longing though long gone 
for the health of all forests and cities , 
and one day to visit them , 
one day be rich and free enough to go and see 
who sat beside my path 
one day as i flashed by . and you are the one , 
and animals the car on the road kills 
and leaves stinking in the sun . 
a small thing crawling toward me 
across this dark lawn . bright 
eyes the only thing i 'm sure i see . 
you 've come back to me , 
have n't you , my sweet ? from 
long ago , and very far . through 
crawling dark , my sweet , you 've 
come back to me , have you ? even 
smaller this time than the stars . 
i pass my grey mornings re-running the reels 
the actors bow gently to me and i envy them 
their repeated parts , their constant presence in that world 
walking through corridors of glass framed pages 
telling each other the final lines of letters 
and the images are the same , their constant presence in that world 
the actors bow gently to me and envy my grey mornings 
i would be eight people with the rib-cage of an elephant 
picking fruit in a warm house above actors bowing 
re-running the reels of my presence in this world 
eight people , glass corridors , page lines repeated 
fragile like a child is fragile . 
destined not to be forever . 
destined to become other 
to mother . here i am 
sitting on a chair , thinking 
about you . thinking 
about how it was 
to talk to you . 
how sometimes it was wonderful 
and sometimes it was awful . 
how drugs when drugs were 
but not entirely 
because good could always be seen 
glimmering like lame glimmers 
in the window of a shop 
called beautiful 
things never last forever . 
i loved you . i love you . you were . 
and you are . life is experience . 
it 's all so simple . experience is 
the chair we sit on . 
the sitting . the thinking 
of you where you are a blank 
to be filled 
in by missing . i loved you . 
i love you like i love 
all beautiful things . 
true beauty is truly seldom . 
you were . you are 
in may . may now is looking onto 
the june that is coming up . 
this is how i measure 
the year . everything was my fault 
has been the theme of the song 
i 've been singing , 
even when you 've told me to quiet . 
i have n't been quiet . 
i 've been crying . i think you 
have forgiven me . you keep 
putting your hand on my shoulder 
when i 'm crying . 
thank you for that . and 
the brightest thing in the shop window 
and the most beautiful seldom i ever saw . 
you who want 
knowledge , 
within . 
there you 
will find 
the clear mirror 
already waiting . 
you who want 
knowledge , 
there you 
will find 
the clear mirror 
already waiting 
you who wronged a simple man 
bursting into laughter at the crime , 
and kept a pack of fools around you 
to mix good and evil , to blur the line , 
though everyone bowed down before you , 
saying virtue and wisdom lit your way , 
glad to have survived another day , 
do not feel safe . the poet remembers . 
you can kill one , but another is born . 
the words are written down , the deed , the date . 
and you 'd have done better with a winter dawn , 
a rope , and a branch bowed beneath your weight . 
on waking , clover as a syrup of spring mind . working 
lunch . you 're a little one with sand in your eyes , with 
green on your horn , with milk on your chin . with flow- 
she slipped through the straw and fell in . 
i seemed always standing 
before a door 
to which i had no key , 
although i knew it hid behind it 
a gift for me . 
until one day i closed 
my eyes a moment , stretched 
then looked once more . 
and not surprised , i did not mind it 
and , smiling , death 
held out his hands to me . 
dance off your wrists , each day ready , 
swollen , not yet set . you gather handful 
after miracle handful , seeing straight , 
reaching the lighthouse in record time , 
twins , carried on your backs , each vow 
new to touch and each mistake a broken 
of tuesday to tuesday and you 're gone , 
the sky has been dark 
for many years . 
my skin has become as damp 
and pale as rice paper 
and feels the way 
mother 's used to before the drying sun 
parched it out there in the fields . 
lately , when i touch my eyelids , 
i had just touched something 
hot enough to burn . 
especially in the evenings 
when the pain flares up . 
this morning 
she was in a good humor , 
making jokes about her great breasts , 
floating in the milky water 
i scrubbed them with a sour taste 
in my mouth , thinking : 
six children and an old man 
have sucked from these brown nipples . 
i was almost tender 
when i came to the blue bruises 
she sighed deeply , her eyes closed . 
it seems it has always 
been like this : the two of us 
in the afternoons 
when she has rested , 
we eat in the familiar silence . 
even now planning my escape . 
as i toast to her health 
with the tea she has poured , 
a thousand cranes curtain the window , 
fly up in a sudden breeze . 
the youngest living thing in l. a. was my baby . 
the oldest living thing was the wind . 
the wind grew well in that city in the desert . 
as did my garden of well-tended cement . 
and he grew and the wind blew and we lived in that desert and . . . no rain . no rain , no river . no sound of water . but for- 
the fountain water . 
we stood on the fountain 's shore : woman + newborn . 
i named the baby easter island . 
we played i spy . 
i saw : statues in the fountain 's water . statues in tall grasses on the shore of a sea . i turned to tell somebody . the city had disappeared into complete silence . there was only : the baby . 
we were watching the water wrinkle in the wind . 
in the distance , maids were ironing . 
the drift of the maker is dark . 
beware that by the drifts thou perish not . 
the statues , the statues in the strange fountain were looking at us . they were weeping and turning , turning and weeping . 
they might have seen the city shimmering in the sun and wind , and known . . . it was a city with no one in it . if a door somewhere on the street opened , it would always be . . . no one . 
it would be a bad draft that had blossomed . 
i longed for meadows white with drifts of snow . i named the baby drift . 
city whose sky was white jet streaks . 
whose only water was the strange fountain . 
there may have been other names i gave the baby . 
little fellow little fellow 
i said to the baby , we will stand here until there is snow on the mountain . 
i may have meant to say fountain . 
i held the baby all the time , and he never ever cried . 
even if my sister and i should wear some , 
or if we give others away , 
they will always be your clothes without you , 
as we will always be your daughters without you . 
when i saw one of those men touch your hair , 
i heard for the first time in many a year 
the ancient battle trumpets and i saw 
the banners of an army winding off to war 
him out with one punch , send him tumbling to the floor . 
if nobody had held me back , stopped me , 
i would-god help me-have killed him on the spot , 
but you must be aware your winding hair 
yes , like a ball of snakes in a flower basket , dear . 
your husband is stretched out on the ground 
as if he were listening for something . 
ask him to come back to the table . 
whatever was there is now here . 
your idea of embracing horror 
in the mild 
that commands a vision of bank towers 
shell of the moon ... on the height where you stand 
and still ca n't understand your life 
as anything but slow dying , your time seeps out 
if you like let the body feel 
& amp ; feathers & amp ; fingers 
door by door , a ragged 
hear a bare sound 
on the path , find 
a red-eye-hole rabbit , fat 
to the core so you can 
will bury your bones 
after your tree family , father or mother in the fairy-ring 
next to you , find you 
are most closely related to grass 
plants from which arose the bee before the 
surrounding the sun become 
the earth you 
had no nouns , did you 
to get just before christmas , 
considering my reasonable health , 
marriage spicy as moo-goo-gai-pan , 
not bad , considering what can go wrong : 
the bony finger of uncle sam 
might point out my husband , 
my own national guard , 
my boss could take a personal interest ; 
the pain in my left knee could spread to my right . 
still , as the old year tips into the new , 
his legs in the air . i wo n't give in 
to the dark , the sub-zero weather , the fog , 
their four-year-old has arranged 
so they , too , worship the child , 
joining the cow and sheep . or else , 
ultimate mortals , they 've come to eat 
then savor the newborn babe . 
our last night in the house was not our last . 
the furniture in the morning.a country where 
they turned back time . 
if your house 
is a dress 
it 'll fit like 
los angeles 
red sun 
burning west , 
deserts , fields , 
for certain it will 
a boy no less 
wandering from shore 
to crest , others 
mistake his 
searching for 
despair , no , 
never , but 
for thirst , 
he is , warm , 
radiant in a 
house dress .
